# D&D 5th Edition Armory Remix

Each edition of Dungeons and Dragons has seen a tweaking of the weapon and armor tables. What has been presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook is the most streamlined and simplified equipment lists yet. Gone are the days of weapons with specific bonuses againsts certain types of armor and damage dice that vary based on the size of the wielder or the target. No longer do we have to worry about keeping track of weapon critical threat ranges or critical damage multipliers or different rates of fire. Say good-bye to specific armor skill check penalties and weapon group proficiency bonuses. For the most part the game benefits from the refinement. However, after playing for awhile now I began to feel that there was something missing, that there wasn't quite enough variety or distintion between items, and a few glaring ommisions.

In this document I present my take on expanding and improving upon the armor and weapon lists. In addition to including a selection of items from previous editions there are a few new weapon and armor properties detailed which add flavor to and create meaningful distinctions between items. I've also added suggestions on how to tweak items further using the new weapon and armor properties to create custom high quality or low quality items. 

Wherever possible an effort was made to work within the framework of the existing ruleset and not to overburden players and DMs with arbitraty modifiers, new combat mechanics, or overshadow existing class features, racial abilities, or feats. All ideas presented here are optional and could be used independent of each other. For example, you might decide to use the new weapon and armor lists but ignore the new properties, or you might use only a few new properties and ignore others. Feel free to hack the system to your personal preferences and feedback is always welcome.

## Weapons

Something as simple as the choice of a favored weapon can have a major impact on the overall feel and flavor of a character. Certain weapons pair so frequently with certain roles and character archtypes that we rarely question it: Fierce warriors like to swing axes, while knights tend to favor swords, and mindless grunts prefer heavy bludgeons. However when you look at the stats for these items there is no inherent reason nor mechanical difference why they this is. You might choose to equip your character with battleaxe, longsword, or warhammer but the choice is largely a colorful one and has no impact on the game, ignoring the unusual circumstance of damage type resistance that is. 

On closer inspection of the weapon table in the Player's Handbook you might notice that something is missing or feels slightly off. Perhaps you envisioned your fighter as a spear and shield type of soldier, but then realized you'd be at a mechanical disadvantage by not choosing the superior longsword instead. Maybe you wanted to equip your army of gnomes with reach weapons only to find that there are practically no reasonable items they can use effectively. You might have even wondered why the trident requires a martial proficiency when it has the same stats as a simple spear. Or you've asked yourself, "Where have some of my favorite weapons gone, like the broadsword, scythe, scourge, khopesh, falchion, bill-guisarme, and bec-de-corbin?"

Following are a collection of old weapons and new weapon properties that can be used to create distinctive weapons and add more interesting choices for your characters.

### New Weapon Properties

*A street thug sneaks up on an unsuspecting victim, club in hand, knowing that one quick strike to the back of the head will most likely render his target unconscious. A weapon master teaches her students the finer points of spear fighting and how a quick change in grip can extend their reach to strike opponents at a distance. A seasoned warrior grits his teeth and sets his pike in preparation to recieve the front ranks of the charging orc horde. With a flick of the wrist a monk wraps her whip around the ankles of a fleeing enemy. A dual-wielding swordsman's quick flashing blades deter his enemies from trying to slip past him, while nearby his companions easily dodge under the slow and clumsy strikes of an ogre's greatclub.*

Weapons tend to fall into certain categories based on how they are best used. Heavy weapons are slow but punishing when they connect. Light blades excel at quick strikes, while larger blades cut deeply. Whips and chains can wrap around obstacles or even be used with some skill to entangle targets. Applying the following new weapon properties helps to reinforce these ideas. See *Appendix B* for a listing of weapons grouped by each property. 

**Balanced.** A weapon with this property is particularly well-balanced or suited to exploiting tactical openings. You have Advantage on Opportunity Attacks using this weapon. Double-edged swords of short to medium length tend to be more **balanced** than other types of weapons. A **balanced** weapon cannot also be **slow**.

**Brutal.** These weapons make the most of brute strength. When the you satisfy the minimum Strength requirement in the parentheses you do greater than average damage. If the result of any rolled weapon damage die is 1, reroll it and take the new result instead. This includes any extra damage dice provided by a critical hit or Martial Arts damage, but does not include sneak attack damage dice or spell damage dice. This benefit is lost against targets wearing **durable** armor. Impaling, crushing, and **heavy** weapons tend to also be **brutal**. A **brutal** weapon cannot also be **light** or **feeble**.

**Feeble.** This weapon is weak, brittle, or otherwise poorly made and deals less damage than usual. If the result of any weapon damage die is its max value, reroll it and take the new result. A **feeble** weapon cannot also be **brutal**. 

**Flexible.** A weapon with this property can be used to neutralize the benefits of shields and cover. As long as the attacker can see the target an attack made with this weapon ignores AC bonuses from shields or half cover and treats three-quarter cover as only half cover. Whips, chains, and flails are all **flexible** weapons.

**Grappling.** These weapons can be used to make a grappling attack instead of doing damage. Using a weapon in this way does not require you to have a free hand and you make a melee or ranged weapon attack roll in place of a STR (Athletics) check, but otherwise works in the same way as a normal grappling Attack. **Grappling** weapons tend to also be **flexible** and **monk** weapons, but aren't required to be either.

**High Crit.** These weapons deal unusually large amounts of damage on a critical hit. Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon maximize the base damage and then roll any extra crit damage dice normally. This feature is nullified by targets wearing **tough** armor. Chopping weapons like axes and single edged swords and impaling weapons like picks tend to be **high crit** weapons.

**Lunging.** Some one-handed weapons are long and light enough to be used as a reach weapon, but do less damage beyond 5'. When making a reach attack with a **lunging** weapon use the lower damage die listed in parentheses. You cannot use this feature while also using a **versatile** weapon in both hands. A **lunging** weapon cannot also be **heavy** or **two-handed**.

**Monk.** Weapons with this property count as Monk weapons and can be used with the Martial Arts feature (PHB pg.78) if not already included. **Monk** weapons tend to be simple weapons without the **heavy** or **two-handed** properties, although there are a few select martial weapons that are included as well.

**Oversized.** This weapon is larger and heavier than most **versatile** weapons and difficult to use properly without exceptional strength. If you do not meet minimum Strength requirement in the parentheses the **versatile** property and is replaced with the **two-handed** property instead.

**Powerdraw.** Especially powerful bows made from reinforced, rare, or composite materials derive their damage from raw strength. When applied to a shortbow or longbow this property allows you to use your Strength modifier for attack and damage bonuses in place of Dexterity. The weapon cannot be used if the minimum Strength requirement in parentheses is not met.

**Reapeating.** When applied to a crossbow of any type this property replaces the loading property of that weapon when used with an appropriate magazine that still has ammunition in it. The size of the magazine supported is listed in parentheses. Reloading a magazine takes an action.

**Set.** A weapon with this property is highly effective when properly used against charging opponents. When you use a readied action to Attack an opponent with this weapon that has moved at least 10' toward you, that attack has Advantage and if it hits treat the hit as a critical hit. Spear-like piercing weapons tend to have the **set** property.

**Slow.** These weapons are slow to recover and are too heavy or cumbersome to use effectively as a reaction. An attack with a weapon with this property has Disadvantage on Opportunity Attacks. **Heavy** and **two-handed** weapons tend to be **slow**. A **slow** weapon cannot also be **balanced**.

**Sneaky.** This weapon is especially dangerous when used to strike a distracted or unaware foe. If you hit with this weapon and had Advantage with the attack, treat the hit as a critical hit. It can also be used with a Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, if not already allowed. **Sneaky** weapons tend to be simple, small, silent, and easily concealable. 

**Underwater.** A weapon with this property can be used underwater without Disadvantage(PHB pg. 198). **Underwater** weapons tend to be piercing and thrusting weapons.

### Customizing Weapons

When creating your own weapons or customizing existing here are a few guidelines that will help to keep things balanced:

* Simple weapons tend to do less damage and have fewer beneficial keywords than Martial weapons. 
* Common tools and farming implements also can be used as Simple weapons.
* Light weapons tend to do low damage since they can be used in the off-hand for a bonus attack.
* Finesse weapons tend to do low damage as well since they can be used in conjunction with Sneak Attack.
* Light and Finesse weapons should not also be Heavy.
* Reach and Two-handed weapons tend to be Heavy.
* Thrown weapons have a maximum range which is 3x its short range.
* Ammunition weapons have a maximum range which is 4x its short range.

#### High Quality Weapons

In some cases it's okay to break the game balance guidelines above, especially when you want to create a unique and memorable item. High quality weapons are rare and valuable. Some are expertly crafted and can be considered masterwork items, others are made of rare materials that grant them special properties. A high quality weapon can have one or more of the following benefits above and beyond the stats of its base item:

* Add the **high crit** or **brutal** property
* Add the **finesse** or **light** property or remove **heavy** property
* Add the **balanced** property or remove the **slow** property
* Add the **powerdraw** property to a shortbow or longbow or add the **repeating** property to a crossbow
* Remove the **oversized** property
* Reduce STR requirement for **brutal** or **oversized** weapons

#### Low Quality Weapons

On the other hand you might wish to create a low-tech campaign or equip your monsters with crude weaponry. Low quality weapons might be ancient and deteriorated, damaged in some way, poorly crafted, or made from primative or substandard materials. A low quality weapon can have one or more of the following drawbacks in addition to any from its base item:

* Add the **feeble** property or remove either the **high crit** or **brutal** property
* Add the **heavy** property or remove either the **light** or **finesse** property
* Add the **slow** property or remove the **balanced** property
* Add the **oversized** property if the weapon is **versatile**
* Increase the **brutal** STR requirement for **brutal** or **oversized** weapons

## Armor and Shields

The number of options available on the armor and shields list in the Player's Handbook might strike you as a bit boring and lacking in variety. Here I try to remedy that by offering some new types of armor and shields as well as some new special properties to make things a little more interesting.

### New Armor and Shield Properties

Just as some weapons pose additional threats, the right kind of armor can neutralize those threats. Likewise a shield is not only useful in deflecting blows in close combat, but a hefty shield when used properly can offer a much needed source of cover from explosions, magical blasts, and bursts of dragon's breath.

**Covering.** Shields with the **covering** property can be treated as cover while prone and crouching behind it. Medium shields provide half-cover to one creature and large shields provide three-quarter cover to one creature or half-cover to two adjacent creatures. Small shields do not provide any cover. Take only the AC bonus from the shield or cover condition depending on how it's being used, but not both.

**Cumbersome.** Armor with this property weighs the wearer down and can slow movement. The wearer must meet the minimum STR requirement in the parenthese or have their base movement speed be reduced by 10' while wearing this armor.

**Durable.** This armor provides additional protection and cushioning against heavy hitting impacts from **brutal** weapons, effectively allowing the wearer to ignore that property. All damage from **brutal** weapons is rolled normally. Scale mail, banded plate mail, and full plate are all **durable**.

**Restrictive.** Armor with this property restricts the full range of motion, making it difficult to move quickly and quietly. The wearer has Disadvantage with stealth checks while wearing this armor.

**Tough.** This armor is reinforced around the vital areas making it harder to land deadly blows and allowing the wearer to ignore the **high crit** property of any weapons. Roll damage normally for a critical hit from any **high crit** weapons. Half plate, splint plate mail, and full plate are all considered **tough**.

**Unwieldy.** Large shields are cumbersome and difficult to carry in one hand by all but the exceptionally strong. All melee attacks are made at Disadvantage while carrying a large shield unless the wielder meets the minimum STR requirement in parentheses. However a large shield can be set on the ground as an action and used as cover until picked up again with another action.

### New Armor and Shields

Following are a few new options for armor and shields. For a full listing of stats see *Appendix D*.

**Banded Plate Mail.** Heavy armor made from overlapping horizontal plates of metal attached to a backing of chain mail and a padded undertunic. Also known as **banded plate**, **banded mail**, **laminar armor**, or simple **banded armor**.

**Brigandine.** An armored coat with small rigid plates sewn between layers of cloth which can be easily concealed. Grants more protection than other light armors, but is heavier and a bit more restrictive as a trade-off. Also known as a **coat of plates** or **jack of plates**

**Half and Full Plate.** Layers of interlocking plate armor covering most or all of the body. Half plate usually consists of the breastplate, pauldrons and guantlets while full plate includes vambraces, greaves, arm and neck guards. You can buy a suit of half plate and then later add the other pieces to make a full suit of plate armor.

**Large Shield.** A large heavy shield, sometimes as tall as 5', most often made of metal with a groove in the middle to help it stand upright when placed on the ground. Used on battlefields as a mobile piece of cover for archers. Also known as a **pavise**, **mantlet**, or **tower** shield.

**Medium Shield.** A standard shield usually made of metal, or wood with metal reinforcement. Styles include **scutum**, **heater**, and **kite** shields.

**Small Shield.** A small round shield usually made of wood or leather and possibly with metal reinforcement. Sometimes known as a **target** or **buckler**.

**Splinted Plate Mail.** Heavy armor made from vertical metal ribs, or splints, attached to a backing of chain mail. Also known as **splint mail**, **splinted plate** or simply **splint armor**.
