# D&D 5th Edition Armory Remix

Each edition of Dungeons and Dragons has seen a tweaking of the weapon and armor tables. What has been presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook is the most streamlined and simplified equipment lists yet. Gone are the days of weapons with specific bonuses againsts certain types of armor and damage dice that vary based on the size of the wielder or the target. No longer do we have to worry about keeping track of weapon critical threat ranges or critical damage multipliers or different rates of fire. Say good-bye to specific armor skill check penalties and weapon group proficiency bonuses. For the most part the game benefits from the refinement. However, after playing for awhile now I began to feel that there was something missing, that there wasn't quite enough variety or distintion between items, and in some cases glaringly absent items.

In this document I present my take on expanding and improving upon the armor and weapon lists. In addition to including a selection of items from previous editions there are a few new weapon and armor properties detailed which add flavor to and create meaningful distinctions between items. Near the end I've added suggestions on how to tweak items further using the new weapon and armor properties to create custom high quality or low quality items. 

Wherever possible an effort was made to work within the framework of the existing ruleset and not to overburden players and DMs with arbitraty modifiers, new combat mechanics, or overshadow existing class features, racial abilities, or feats. All ideas presented here are optional and could be used independent of each other. For example, you might decide to use the new weapon and armor lists but ignore the new properties, or you might use only a few new properties and ignore others. Feel free to hack the system to your personal preferences. Feedback is always welcome.

## Weapons
Something as simple as the choice of a favored weapon can have a major impact on the overall feel and flavor of a character. Certain weapons pair so frequently with certain roles and character archtypes that we rarely question it: Fierce warriors like to swing axes, while knights tend to favor swords, and mindless grunts prefer heavy bludgeons. However when you look at the stats for these items there is no inherent reason nor mechanical difference why they this is. You might choose to equip your character with battleaxe, longsword, or warhammer but the choice is largely a colorful one and has no impact on the game, ignoring the unusual circumstance of damage type resistance that is. 

On closer inspection of the weapon table you might notice that something is missing or feels slightly off. Perhaps you envisioned your fighter as spear and shield type of soldier, but then realized you'd be at a mechanical disadvantage by not choosing the superior longsword instead. Maybe you wanted to equip your army of gnomes with reach weapons only to find that there are practically no reasonable items they can use effectively. You might have even wondered why the trident requires a martial proficiency when it has the same stats as a simple spear. Or you've asked yourself, "Where have some of my favorite weapons gone, like the broadsword, scythe, scourge, khopesh, falchion, bill-guisarme, and bec-de-corbin?"

Following are a collection of old weapons and new weapon properties that can be used to create distinctive weapons and add more interesting choices for your characters.

### New Weapon Properties
*A street thug sneaks up on an unsuspecting victim, club in hand, knowing that one quick strike to the back of the head will most likely render his target unconscious. A weapon master teaches her students the finer points of spear fighting and how a quick change in grip can extend their reach to strike opponents at a distance. A pack of kobolds snag a spelunking adventurer in a mancatcher and then drag the helpless wretch through a gauntlet of traps while staying safely out of reach. With a flick of the wrist a monk wraps her whip around the ankles of a fleeing enemy. A dual-wielding swordsman's quick flashing blades deter his enemies from trying to slip past him, while at the same time his companions easily dodge under the slow and clumsy strikes of an ogre's greatclub.*

Weapons tend to fall into certain categories based on how they are best used. Heavy weapons are slow but punishing when they connect. Light blades excel at quick strikes, while larger blades cut deeply. Whips and chains can wrap around obstacles to hit their targets or even be used with some skill to entangle another. Applying some of these new weapon properties helps to reinforce these concepts.

**High Crit.** unusually large damage on a critical hit. Base damage is maximized then roll extra crit damage normally.

**Brutal.** these weapons make the most of brute strength and tend to do more damage on average when the weilder satisfies the minimum strength requirement. if the result of any weapon damage die is 1, reroll it and take the new result instead

**Sneaky.** this weapon is especially effective when used to strike a distracted or unaware foe. If you hit with this weapon and had advantage with the attack, treat the hit as a critical hit. It can also be used with a sneak attack if not already allowed.

**Balanced.** this weapon is particularly well-balanced or suited to exploiting tactical openings, granting it advantage on opportunity attacks.

**Slow.** this weapon is too slow, heavy, or awkward to use properly as a reaction, granting disadvantage on opportunity attacks.

**Flexible.** flexible weapons can be used to wrap around obstacles to strike targets. when attack is made from within 5' it ignores AC bonuses from half cover and shields and treats three quarter cover as half cover 

**Grappling.** weapon can be used to make a Grapple Attack instead of doing damage. Use the weapon's range and attack modifiers instead of a STR (Athletics) check.

**Underwater.** can be used underwater without disadvantage (from PHB)

**Mounted.** this weapon is meant to be used while mounted, otherwise it is used at disadvantage

**Set.** this weapon is more effective when used against charging opponents. a readied attack action against a charge has advantage and if it hits treat the hit as a critical hit.

**Monk.** unarmed strikes, simple weapons without heavy or two-handed keywords, and short swords are considered monk weapons (from PHB)

**Lunging.** can be treated as a one-handed reach weapon, but do less damage beyond 5', use the lower damage die.

**Feeble.** feeble weapons deal less than average damage and are the opposite of Brutal weapons. If the result of any weapon die is its max value, reroll it and take the new result instead

**Powerdraw.** when applied to a shortbow or longbow this allows you to use your strength modifier for attack and damage bonus instead of dexterity

**Reapeating.** when applied to a crossbow of any type this allows you to ignore the loading property of the that weapon when used with an appropriate magazine that still has ammunition in it. The size of the magazine supported is listed in parenthesis. Loading a new magazine takes an action.
