# D&D 5th Edition Expanded Armory

Each edition of Dungeons and Dragons has seen a complete reworking of the basic weapon and armor tables of varying length and complexity. Gone are the days of weapons with specific bonuses againsts certain types of armor and damage dice that vary based on the size of the target or different rates of fire. No longer do we have to worry about keeping track of weapon critical threat ranges or critical damage multipliers. Say goodbye to armor skill check penalties and weapon proficiency bonuses. What has been presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook is by far the most streamlined and simplified equipment lists so far and for the most part the game benefits from it. However, after first blush I felt that there was something missing, that there wasn't quite enough variety or distintion between items, and in some cases glaringly absent items.

In this document I present my take on expanding and improving upon the armor and weapon lists. In addition to including a selection of missing iconic items from previous editions there are a few new weapon and armor properties detailed which add flavor to and create meaningful distinctions between items. Near the end I've added suggestions on how to tweak items further using the new weapon and armor properties to create custom high quality or low quality items.
