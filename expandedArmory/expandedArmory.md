# D&D 5th Edition Armory Remix

Each edition of Dungeons and Dragons has seen a tweaking of the weapon and armor tables. What has been presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook is the most streamlined and simplified equipment lists yet. Gone are the days of weapons with specific bonuses againsts certain types of armor and damage dice that vary based on the size of the target or different rates of fire. No longer do we have to worry about keeping track of weapon critical threat ranges or critical damage multipliers. Say goodbye to specific armor skill check penalties and weapon group proficiency bonuses. For the most part the game benefits from the refinement. However, after playing for awhile now I began to feel that there was something missing, that there wasn't quite enough variety or distintion between items, and in some cases glaringly absent items.

In this document I present my take on expanding and improving upon the armor and weapon lists. In addition to including a selection of items from previous editions there are a few new weapon and armor properties detailed which add flavor to and create meaningful distinctions between items. Near the end I've added suggestions on how to tweak items further using the new weapon and armor properties to create custom high quality or low quality items. 

Wherever possible an effort was made to work within the framework of the existing ruleset and not to overburden players and DMs with arbitraty modifiers, new combat mechanics, or overshadow existing class features, racial abilities, or feats. All ideas presented here are optional and could be used independent of each other. For example, you might decide to use the new weapon and armor lists but ignore the new properties, or you might use only a few new properties and ignore others. Feel free to hack the system to your personal preferences. Feedback is always welcome.

## Weapons
Something as simple as a choice of weapon can have a major impact on the overall feel and flavor of a character. Certain weapons pair so frequently with certain types of characters that we rarely question it: Fierce warriors tend to swing axes, while knights favor swords, and mindless grunts prefer heavy bludgeons. However when you look at the stats for these items there is no inherent reason nor mechanical difference why you might choose to equip your character, monster, or npc with battleaxe, longsword, or warhammer. The choice is purely a colorful one and has no impact on the game (ignoring the unusual circumstance of damage type resistance). 

Perhaps you envision your fighter as a soldier highly trained in field tactics using the spear and shield, but realized you'd be at a mechanical disadvantage by not choosing the superior longsword. Or maybe you want to equip your army of gnomes with reach weapons only to find that there are practically no reasonable items they can use effectively.

Following are a collection of new weapons and weapon properties that can be used to help draw distinctions between weapons and add more interesting choices for your campaigns.

### New Weapon Properties
*A street thug sneaks up on an unsuspecting victim, club in hand, knowing that one quick strike to the back of the head will most likely render his target unconscious. A weapon master teaches her students the finer points of spear fighting and how a quick change in grip can extend their reach to strike opponents at a distance. A pack of kobolds snag a spelunking adventurer in a mancatcher and then drag the helpless wretch through a gauntlet of traps while staying safely out of reach. With a flick of the wrist a monk wraps her whip around the ankles of a fleeing enemy. A dual-wielding swordsman's flashing blades easily slash and cut his enemies as they try to slip past him, while at the same time he easily dodges under the slow and clumsy strikes of an ogre's greatclub.*

Weapons tend to fall into certain categories based on how they are best applied. Heavy weapons are slow but punishing when they connect. Light blades excel at quick strikes, while larger blades create deadly wounds. Applying these new weapon properties helps to reinforce these concepts.
