# Armory Remix v2.3

A *street thug with club in hand sneaks up on an unsuspecting mark knowing that one quick strike to the back of the head will render his victim unconscious. Students listen intently to their weapons master as she instructs them on the finer points of spear fighting and how a quick change in grip can extend their reach to strike opponents at a distance. A veteran soldier, standing in formation shoulder to shoulder to green recruits, grits his teeth as he sets his pike to recieve the front ranks of the charging orc horde. With a flick of the wrist a bounty hunter wraps her whip around the ankles of a fleeing bounty enabling her to claim the full reward for bringing him in alive. A dual-wielding swordsman's quick flashing blades deter his enemies from trying to slip past him, while nearby his lightly armored halfling companion easily dodges past the slow and clumsy strikes of an ogre's greatclub.*

The 5th edition Player's Handbook presents a very streamlined and simplified equipment list. It serves as a fine starting point for most campaigns, but it lacks a certain amount of variety. This rules supplement presents new weapons, armor, shields and related properties inspired by previous editions to add flavor, provide interesting choices, and create meaningful distinctions between items. In addition to new items and properties there are rules on how to tweak items further to create custom high-quality or low-quality items and a list of updates to rules regarding proficincies and feats that deal with armor, shields, and weapons.

## Weapons

Weapons are distinquished by a set of properties that describe how they perform in battle. Large weapons are slow and unbalanced. Small hidden weapons can be suprisingly deadly in the right hands. Chopping blades cut deeply and heavy bludgeons deliver staggering blows. Whips and chains can wrap around obstacles or even be used with some skill to entangle targets. Spear-like thrusting weapons are best at repelling charges and for use in the water. 

The following weapon properties and their effects reinforce these ideas. Several of the weapon properties require proficiency in the weapon in order to gain their benefits. In some cases they replace existing table elements defined in the PHB.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

### Weapon Properties
___

* **Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged Attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you Attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the Attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee Attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Ammunition weapons have a maximum range which is 4x its short range.

* **Bracing.** These weapons are more effective when braced and set against charging opponents. If you are proficient with this weapon, Readied Attack Actions against an advancing opponent have Advantage. Brace weapons tend to be **two-handed** or **versatile** piercing weapons, like spears and pikes. Brace weapons should not also have the **slow** property.

* **Brutal.** These weapons create deep vicious wounds that tend to bleed. If you are proficient with this weapon treat any 1 rolled on a weapon damage die as a 2. This includes any additional critical hit dice and dice provided by sneak attack, but does not include dice provided by spells or other features. This property is negated by **hardened** armor. Axes and other curved slashing weapons tend to have the brutal property.

* **Finesse.** When making an Attack with a **finesse** weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the Attack and Damage Rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Finesse weapons tend to do less damage than non-finesse weapons because they can be used with Sneak Attack. Finesse weapons tend to not be **heavy**, **slow**, or **two-handed**. Finesse weapons tend to do low damage since they can be used in conjunction with Sneak Attack.

___

* **Flexible.** A weapon with this property consists of multiple interlocking rigid parts or made entirely of a flexible material like rope or leather. Due to it's flexible nature it can neutralize the benefits of shields and cover. As long as the attacker is proficient with the weapon and can see the target in range an attack made with this weapon ignores up to +2 AC bonus granted by shields or cover. Whips, chains, and flails are all **flexible** weapons.

* **Grappling.** These weapons are made from entangling cords, chains, nets, or have special hooks designed for grabbing and can be used to make a grappling attack instead of doing damage, if you are proficient. Using a weapon in this way does not require you to have a free hand. You can make a melee or ranged weapon attack roll in place of a STR (Athletics) check and in all other ways works the same as a normal grappling attack. To maintain a grapple with this weapon you must keep at least one hand on it. **Grappling** weapons tend to also be **flexible** weapons, but aren't required to be.

* **Heavy.** A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make difficult to wield for small creatures and for all creatures while mounted. A small creature or mounted creature has Disadvantage on Attack rolls with **heavy** weapons. Heavy weapons tend to be **slow** and **two-handed** and should not also have the **mounted** property.

* **High-crit.** These weapons deal higher than normal damage on a critical hit due to cruel spikes or barbs that pierce armor and strike at vital organs. If you are proficient with this weapon and get a critical hit, any weapon damage die that is a max value (i.e. 6 on a d6) can be rolled again and added to the total damage. These additional dice are not rolled again even if they result in a max value. This feature is negated by targets wearing **hardened** armor. Impaling weapons like picks and spears tend to be **high-crit**.

* **Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Light weapons should not also be **heavy**, **two-handed**, or **slow**. Light weapons tend to often be **finesse** and **sneaky**. Light weapons tend to do low damage since they can be used in the off-hand for a bonus attack.

* **Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. A **loading** weapon should not also have the **repeating** property.

* **Lunging.** Some one-handed weapons are long and light enough to be used to sacrifice power to gain reach. When making a reach attack with a **lunging** weapon use the lower damage die listed in parentheses. You cannot use this feature while holding the weapon in both hands or if you are not proficient with this weapon. A **lunging** weapon is typically not also **heavy**, **reach**, or **two-handed**.

* **Monk.** Weapons with this property count as Monk weapons that can be used with the Martial Arts feature. **Monk** weapons tend to be simple weapons without the **heavy** or **two-handed** properties, however there are a few select martial weapons that are specifically included.

* **Mounted.** Mounted weapons are most effective when used while mounted. You have disadvantage when you use a mounted weapon to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a mounted weapon requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted. Mounted weapons tend to be piercing, **slow**, and **reach** weapons.

* **Powerdraw.** Especially powerful bows are constructed of reinforced, rare, or composite materials while others are recurved. These bows derive their damage from the increased strength necessary to pull it. When applied to a short bow or long bow this property increases the range and allows you to use your Strength modifier for damage rolls in place of Dexterity. **Powerdraw** bows are rare and valuable.

* **Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged Attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the Attack roll. You can’t Attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

* **Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you Attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it. Polearms, two-handed weapons, whips, and chains all tend to be reach weapons. Reach weapons also tend to be **heavy** and **slow**.

* **Repeating.** When applied to a crossbow of any type this property replaces the loading property of that weapon when used with an appropriate magazine that still has ammunition in it. The typical magazine holds up to 6 bolts. Reloading a repeating crossbow takes an action. The Crossbow Expert Feat reduces the reload time to a Bonus Action.

* **Slow.** These weapons are unbalanced, heavy, or too awkward to use quickly. Therefore any attack made as a Reaction with this weapon has Disadvantage. This includes opportunity attacks and readied attacks. Large **staggering**, **heavy** and **two-handed** weapons tend to be **slow**. A **slow** weapon should not have the **brace** property.

* **Sneaky.** This weapon is especially dangerous when used to strike a distracted or unaware foe. If you hit with this weapon and had Advantage with the attack, use the higher damage die listed. It can also be used with a Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, if not already allowed. **Sneaky** weapons tend to be simple, small, silent, and easily concealable. They also tend to be low damaging. A sneaky weapon should not also have the **heavy**, **two-handed**, or **versatile** properties.

* **Staggering.** These weapons rely on heavy mass to deliver staggering blows. If you are proficient with this weapon and get a critical hit on a creature, that creature cannot take reactions until the beginning of their next turn. Staggering weapons tend to be bludgeoning, **heavy**, or **slow**. Staggering weapons can not also be **light** or **finesse**.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page
___

* **Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged Attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that Attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee Attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a hand axe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Thrown weapons are usually not **two-handed**, **heavy**, or **slow**. Thrown weapons have a maximum range which is 3x its short range.

* **Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands when you Attack with it. Weapons with the **two-handed** property tend to be **reach**, **slow** or **heavy**. Two-handed weapons should not be **light**, **finesse**, **lunging**, **monk**, or **versatile**.

* **Underwater.** A weapon with this property can be used underwater without Disadvantage. **Underwater** weapons tend to be piercing and thrusting weapons.

* **Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property, the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack. Versatile weapons should not also be **two-handed** or **light**.

* **Weak.** A weapon with this property is fragile, made of sub-standard materials, or worn with age. When you hit with an attack roll and deal max damage or get a critical hit this weapon becomes broken and unuseable. Improvised, practice, ceremonial, or ancient weapons do not stand up to abuse and tend to be **weak**.

### Simple Melee Weapons

Simple melee weapons are easily made or improvised from tools on hand. Commoners frequently have a access to a dagger, club, quarterstaff, or farming implements while militia and guards are often equipped with a mace or spear. Savage humanoids often wield clubs, great clubs, and javelins due their simple construction.

___
* **Axe.** A small light-weight single-edged chopping axe. A common tool among settlers in forested climates it is also useful as a weapon or thrown missile in a pinch.

* **Club and Great Club.** A bludgeon made of wood, bone, stone, or even a leather stack filled with sand or rocks. Clubs are rarely crafted and are often improvised from objects on hand. A regular club is a small one-handed weapons while a great club is a larger two-handed weapon. Clubs and great clubs are favored among brutish humanoids and less intelligent giants.

* **Dagger.** A small one-handed stabbing or slashing weapon that comes in a variety of shapes and styles. Traditional daggers have a flat and wide pointed blade while stilettos have a long and narrow blade. Knives generally have a single edged blade for slashing and cutting. Daggers can be wielded in either hand, thrown, and used in close combat making them a very useful backup or secondary weapon.

* **Flail.** Two short sections of wood or metal connected by a small chain or hinge. Originally intended as a tool for threshing grain it can be used as a flexible bludgeoning weapon as well.

* **Hammer.** A one-handed hammer useful as a hand tool, a bludgeon, or a throwing weapon. A favorite skirmishing weapon among dwarves, gnomes, and other mining races.

* **Javelin.** A short spear primarily meant as a throwing weapon but can be used as a one-handed stabbing weapon as well. Cheap and easily fabricated, it is a common weapon among tribal humanoids and frequently issued to foot soldiers as a skirmishing weapon.

* **Lasso.** A length of rope tied into a loop, slip knot, or noose that can be thrown around a target to restraint it. It takes two hands to properly control a lasso. It doesn't cause any damage directly but can be used to grapple, restrain, and possibly strangle a target.

* **Mace.** A one-handed bludgeon specifically crafted as a weapon often having a heavy rounded or flanged head to increase the impact. Simple maces are issued to civil peace-keeping forces for protection and as a symbol of authority.

* **Pick.** A small one-handed pick usually used for breaking up dirt or rocks but also useful for piercing flesh.

* **Quarter Staff.** A rod of wood, or rarely metal, between four and six feet long, usually as tall as the wielder, that can be wielded as a weapon in one or two hands. A very common weapon among peasants, pilgrims, and monks for its versatility and simple craftsmanship.

* **Scythe.** A sharp inwardly curved blade attached to a long wooden handle primarily intended for shearing grasses and grain. Can only be properly wielded with two hands.

* **Shovel.** A digging tool with a wide flat metal blade mounted on a four foot long wooden handle. Not an ideal weapon, but it can be useful as an improvised weapon.

* **Sickle.** A small inwardly curved blade mounted on a short handle, basically a one-handed scythe and used in the collection of herbs and clearing of weeds. Similar to a machete, which has a single edged blade and used to chop away brush and debris. 

* **Spear and Long Spear.** Spears are one of the earliest weapons invented by intelligent humanoids and still in wide-spread use. Spears are basically a staff sharpened on one end, tipped with a sharpened metal spearhead, or fashion with a number of prongs in the case of a trident or pitchfork. Spears can be used in a variety of ways and are very effective when braced against a charge. A long spear is longer than a normal spear, reaching lengths of up to 8', and requiring two hands to wield effectively, but is **weak** and prone to breaking.

* **Unarmed Strike.** All humanoids can perform an unarmed strike as an Attack action. It can represent a punch, kick, knee, headbutt, tail slam, shoulder throw, or any other brawling move.

### Simple Range Weapons

Simple range weapons are typically used for hunting but can be used in battle when needed. Commoners often own a sling or a short bow while militia and town guards are frequently equipped with light crossbows.
___

* **Dart.** A dart is a small specialized throwing weapon, similar to an arrow, with a short shaft, fletching, and a weighted head. It can also be used as ammunititon for the **dart thrower** which extends the range and power of the dart.

* **Light Crossbow and Repeating Light Crossbow.** A small mechanical bow mounted horizontally onto a wooden stock which fires bolts when a trigger is depressed. The bow must be reset and bolts must be loaded individually between shots. A wall manned with guards equipped with light crossbows is an effective deterent. A **repeating** light crossbow has been modified to use a magazine of bolts which replaces the need to load after every shot.

* **Net.** A grid of woven and knotted rope or vines meant to entrap and entangle other creatures. It causes no direct damage but imposes the Restrained condition on a target it hits. A net has no effect on a creature that is formless, Huge, or larger. The net can be cut by doing 5 points of slashing damage to it (AC 10), effectively freeing a captured creature. Being a thrown weapon with a very short range it suffers from Disadvantage in most cases, unless you have a special feat or other source of Advantage to cancel it out. 

* **Short Bow and Recurve Short Bow.** A short bow is a small bow that is meant for short range or can be used while mounted. A recurve short bow is shaped with additional curves to increase its range and adds the **powerdraw** property and are often crafted of composited materials to add spring and resilience to the bow.

* **Sling.** A sling is a simple leather thong with a pouch use for hurling stones or metal bullets. It is a common weapon among shepherds and other common folk and can be easily stored in a pouch along with stones and bullets.

### Martial Melee Weapons

Martial melee weapons are crafted specifically for battle and meant to be wielded by trained warriors and soldiers. Common soldiers are typically outfitted with a polearm and a light one-handed weapon as a fallback, while commanders and elite soldiers tend to use versatile or great weapons. Martial melee weapons tend to do more damage and have more beneficial properties than their simple counterparts, yet the also cost more and aren't as readily available.

___

* **Battle Axe and Great Axe.** A battle axe is a long handled single-bladed axe that can be wielded in one or two hands. Similar weapons include military cleavers and the khopseh, which is an exotic-looking axe-like sword with an outwardly curving blade. A great axe is a heavier version of the battle axe, often doube-bladed, meant to be wielded in two-hands. Axes are a favored weapon among brutal humanoids like orcs that like to intimidate their opponents.

* **Broad Sword.** A sword with wide double-edged blade with very little taper and a short pommel. The length is about midway between a short sword and a long sword, reaching lengths up to 3'. It is often considered a pre-cursor to the long sword.

* **Chain.** A chain is a length of interlocking metal loops or bars and weighted on the ends. It can be used to whip, flail, or grapple opponents. Some chain weapons are spiked or have blades attached to the weighted ends.

* **Gauntlet, Clawed Gauntlet, or Spiked Gauntlet.** A gauntlet is a metal or weighted leather glove, usually worn as part of a suit of armor, that can add additonal impact to unarmed strikes. Gauntlets can be modified to include claws or spikes which cause additional slashing or piercing damage in hand-to-hand combat.

* **Glaive.** A glaive is a single-edged slashing blade mounted on a long pole. A glaive is one of the few reach weapons that is not also slow. Similar weapons include the bill and fauchard.

* **Halberd.** A halberd is an axe-bladed polearm, which may also feature a long spike on the end or a hooked blade opposite the axe-head. It allows the user to chop or pierce opponents. It is frequently wielded by palace guards or deployed against pike walls to cut long weapons while safely out of reach.

* **Lance, Light Lance, Heavy Lance, and Jousting Lance.** Lances are long spears with a one-handed grip meant to be used while mounted. Due to their length and relatively light weight compared to the force generated by striking with a mounted charge all lances are prone to breakage and have the **weak** property. Due to this fact a backup weapon is usually necessary. Jousting lances are meant to be use in practice and sport, while true lances come in a variety of weights depending on the size and strength of the mount and rider. Lances are favored among cavaliers, paladins, and other knights.

* **Long Sword and Great Sword.** The long sword is the melee weapon to which all others weapons are compared. Long swords come in a variety of styles but all feature a 3' to 4' double-edged blade that sharpens to a point, a wide cross-guard, and an elongated grip with a weighted pommel for counter-balance. It balances speed, versatility, and lethality and is a favorite choice among adventurers and nobles. It is also one of the most common weapons to be enchanted. The great sword is a massive long sword meant to be weilded in two hands with blades that can reach up to 6' in length. They are typically wielded by heavily armored knights.

* **Man Catcher.** A collar-like ring of inwardly pointing barbs mounted on the end of a long pole. Intended to be used to unhorse riders and capture targets rather than kill them.

* **Morning Star.** Not to be confused with a ball and chain, a morningstar is a large mace studded with spikes or alternatively a large club with with nails or other sharpened protrusions projecting from it. It is a nasty weapon favored among brutes and bugbears.

* **Nunchaku.** A light flail-like weapon optimized for martial arts and duel wielding.

* **Pike.** A very long spear meant to be used with two-hands and in formation with other pikemen. Similar to pikes are other thrusting spear-like polearms including the partisan, ranseur, and spetum.

* **Pole Hammer.** A long pole with a head shaped like a cross-between a hammer and a pick allowing the user to do either bludgeoning or piercing damage. Sometimes called a lucern hammer or bec-de-corbin based on the length of the spike or "beak".

* **Punching Dagger.** A short bladed dagger with a T-shaped or H-shaped handle meant to be gripped in the fist with the blade protruding forward from the knuckles. It generally lacks a crossguard and cannot be thrown, trading versatility for increased force.

* **Rapier.** A long thin bladed sword meant for fencing and thrusting, often carried as a symbol of prestige and favored among nobles. They often have elaborate crossguards or basket hilts to protect the wielder's hand.

* **Scimitar.** A short curved single-edged sword that makes for an effective weapon and all-purpose chopping tool. Popular among pirates.

* **Scourge.** A short whip with multiple thongs typically made of leather. The thongs are often tipped with knots or sharp metal tips in order to cause additional pain.

* **Short Sword.** A small straight sword with a double-edged blade but primarily meant for stabbing. It is often given to soldiers as a back-up weapon for close combat should they not be able to bring polearms to bear.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

___

* **War Flail and Great Flail.** A war flail is a flail fashioned with one or more spiked balls on the end of a long chains specifically crafted for battle and is particularly effective against opponents with shields. A great flail is even larger and heavier and meant to be used with two hands. Flails are a favored weapon among gnolls.

* **War Hammer and Maul.** A battle hammer that can be used with one or two hands, fashioned with either two blunt ends or a blunt end balanced by a short spike. A maul or great hammer is even larger and heavier and can only be wielded in two-hands. Hammers are a favored weapon among the dwarves.

* **War Pick and Great Pick.** A war pick is meant for combat and able to be used in one or two hands. A great pick is larger and heavier and only able to be wielded in two hands.

* **Whip.** A long braided flexible leather cord attached to a stiff handle. Traditionally used to train animals or torture prisoners it can be useful as a weapon as well.

### Martial Range Weapons

Martial range weapons require more training and practice than simple range weapons in order to use them effectively. Trained assassins use blowguns, throwing knives, and hand crossbows while military marksmen typically use long bows and heavy crossbows. Martial range weapons tend to have longer ranges and deal more damage than their simple range weapon counterparts, while costing more and being less common.

___

* **Blowgun.** A long hollow tube with a mouth piece meant for firing small darts, often poisoned. A favored weapon among jungle tribes and assassins.

* **Bolas.** Two or three weights connected by cords that when spun and thrown entangle their target.

* **Dart Thrower.** A specialized tool for hurling **darts** further and harder than possible if thrown. Typically a length of wood roughly the length of the thrower's forearm with a notch at one end that hooks into the back of a dart. These are used by tribal humanoids that may not have access to bows or lack the size and strength to use other thrown weapons.

* **Hand Crossbow or Repeating Hand Crossbow.** A small light one-handed version of a crossbow that fires small bolts. One of the few ranged weapons that can be used in an off-hand. A repeating hand crossbow has been modified to use a magazine which removes the **loading** property. Hand crossbows are a favored weapon among Drow.

* **Heavy Crossbow.** A heavier version of a crossbow equipped with a stirrup or hand crank to make loading easier. Due to the force required to draw the bow it is unlikely to find a repeating heavy crossbow. Heavy crossbows are **heavy** and are difficult to use while mounted.

* **Long Bow or Recurve Long Bow.** A tall bow that takes significant training and practice to use effectively. Long bows can also be recurved or made of composite materials to increase their range and power even more. Long bows are **heavy** and are difficult to use while mounted.

* **Staff Sling.** A sling mounted on a short staff which is used as a fulcrum to hurl stones and bullets much farther and faster than normally possible. The staff portion of the weapon can also be used in melee as a two-handed bludgeoning weapon if necessary.

* **Throwing Knife.** A small sharp blade specially shaped and balanced for accurate throwing. Sometimes double-ended or shaped like a star so that it strikes with a sharp edge no matter how it hits. Smaller and easier to conceal than a dagger throwing knives are favored by spies and assassins.

## Armor

Armor, shields, and helms come in three categories related to the proficiency needed to use them effectively: Light, Medium, and Heavy. 

Light armors are made of layers of cloth and leather while medium and heavy armors tend to use metal rings and plates. Light and medium armors focus on protecting only the vital areas while heavy armor protects the entire body. Heavy armor also tends to be both restrictive and cumbersome. Commoners rarely have anything more than a gambeson, town guards and militia may be issued a suit of ring mail or a chain shirt, while professional soldiers typically wear brigandine or a full suit of chain mail.

Just as some weapons pose unique threats, the right kind of armor can neutralize those threats at the cost of increased encumbrance and reduced mobility. A helm paired with an appropriate suit of armor offers superior protection while limiting perception. A shield is not only useful in deflecting blows in close combat, but can be particularly effective against missiles attacks.

The following are a few new properties along with new options for armor and shields with their own benefits and drawbacks. These are new properties for armor, shields, and helms. In some cases they replace existing table elements defined in the PHB.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### Armor Properties
___

* **Covering.** You can use your Reaction to double the shield's AC bonus against a single ranged weapon or spell attack. This property can be used in conjunction with the **Shield Master** feat.

* **Cumbersome.** Wearing armor without the required strength reduces your movement speed by 5 feet. This reduced speed is in addition to any due to encumbrance. This property replaces the STR requirement listed in the PHB armor table.

* **Hardened.** Armor made of rigid plates is reinforced and better covers vital areas providing improved protection against grevious wounds. The wearer effectively ignores the effects of weapon properties **brutal**, **high-crit**, and **staggering**.

* **Occluding.** Protective headgear can reduce periferal vision and dampens sounds. The wearer of helms with this property suffers a penalty on passive perception checks equal to the number in parentheses.

* **Oversized.** Oversized shields cannot be used while mounted and cannot be wielded by small creatures without two hands.

* **Restricting.** Armor with the this property is bulky and restricts the full range of motion. It cannot be easily disguised and makes it difficult to move quickly and quietly. The wearer has Disadvantage with Dexterity (Stealth) checks, Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, and Strength (Athletics) checks relating to swimming, climbing, and jumping while wearing this armor. This property replaces the Stealth Disadvantage column of the PHB armor table.

* **Spiked.** Armor and shields with this property have been embellished with intimidating metal spikes or something equally dangerous. A shield with spikes does 1d4 piercing damage instead of bludgeoning when used as a weapon or as part of a shove attack. A creature who grapples or is grappled by another creature in spiked armor takes 1d4 piercing damage from the spikes. Armor with spikes also gains the **restricting** property if it doesn't already.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### Light Armor
___

* **Gambeson.** Armor consisting of many thick layers of cloth and batting quilted together covering the chest and arms. It offers some protection while being cheap and easy to craft. Gambeson armor is more common than leather armor and is often worn under heavier armors for comfort and added protection. Common levies are typically outfitted with this type of armor.

* **Leather.** This armor is made of pieces of thick but pliable leather shaped and stitched together to cover the torso and shoulders and may include a skirt, or kilt to protect the thighs. It can be dyed various colors and ornamented in a variety of ways. It offers the same protection as a gambeson while being slightly less bulky and more expensive. Other materials like weaved and lacquered wicker can be made into armor just as effective as leather.

* **Ring Mail.** Ring mail is leather armor with a matrix of large metal rings attached to it. It offers better protect than regular leather armor, but is heavier and costs more. The rings can be made of a variety of metals or even be replaced with bone, stone, or other similar materials. Ring mail is more common in areas where full metal armors are harder to come by and it is favored by pirates in lieu heavier armors.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### Medium Armor

___

* **Breastplate.** Breastplates come in a variety of styles and ornamentation. They all consist of one or more large solid metal plates or discs covering the vital parts of the chest while leaving the arms and legs unprotected, sacrificing additonal protection while remaining relatively unencumbered. Breastplates form the basis of all other **hardened** plate armors. Breastplates are expensive and generally only worn by honor guards, knights, and other nobles.

* **Chain Shirt.** Chain mail is made of flexible mesh of small metal rings. A chain shirt protects only the torso and upper arms and might extend to the thighs, but is lighter than a full suit of chain mail and is can be concealed beneath a tunic. Militia and town guards are often equipped with a simple chain byrnie.

* **Half Plate.** Half plate includes a breastplate paired with metal shoulder and arm plates, often worn over a chain shirt to protect the joints. Only the wealthy and priviledged can afford to wear half plate. Like breastplates is has the **hardened** property. The increased protection comes with more encumbrance and less flexibility, represented by the **cumbersome** and **restricting** properties.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page
___

* **Hide.** Hide armor typically consists of thick layers furs and hides, hard chitin, or boiled and stiffened leathers. It is an armor commonly worn by barbarian tribes, giants, and savage humanoids in areas where better materials are hard to come by. This armor can also represent piecemeal or patchwork armor of other types including the sparse armor of gladiators which usually only includes a single spaulder and a wide leather belt.

* **Scale Mail.** Scale mail is armor that is made of overlapping metal scales, like those of a fish, attached to a leather backing that covers the torso and arms. Variants of scale armor are made entirely of small interlocking coins or discs, similar to ring mail. Scale armor is flexibile to a degree, but bulky and noisy, making it **cumbersome** and **restrictive**.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### Heavy Armor

___

* **Brigandine.** Brigandine consists of a long knee-lengthed armored coat with small rigid plates stitched or riveted between layers of cloth and cinched at the waist by a sturdy leather belt. It is often mistaken for "studded" armor due to the metal rivets or "studs" that sometimes show through the cloth layer. It is the cheapest and lightest of the heavy armors. It is a favored type of armor amongst mercenaries and amateur adventurers for its balance of protection and cost.

* **Full Chain.** A full suit of chain mail covers the entire body and is worn over a gambeson to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. It includes chain gauntlets and leg coverings. The weight of the chain tends to hang on the shoulders and is not well distributed, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Chain mail is the most common type of heavy armor and frequently used by professional soldiers.

* **Full Plate.** Full plate covers the entire body with interlocking shaped metal plates held in place with leather buckles and straps. It includes everything in a suit of half plate and adds guantlets, thigh guards, knee guards, greaves, and sabatons. Due to the cost only the most wealthy knights and nobles can afford to wear this type of armor.

* **Heavy Plate.** Heavy plate is a suit of full plate made of reinforced heavy metal plates that only the strongest of warriors can effectively fight in. This armor is extremely rare and valuable.

* **Plate Mail.** Plate mail comprises of layered metal plates, similar to scale but larger, backed by chain mail all worn over a gambeson. It includes gauntlets, spaulders, heavy boots, and leg coverings.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### Shields

Shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can be made of leather, wood, metal, or other improvised materials. They can sometimes include a reinforced rim and metal boss for added durability. Medium shields are the most commonly used, offering decent protection without the drawbacks of larger shields. Intelligent creatures generally use shields on their own or in combination with armor.
___

* **Small Shield.** A small lightweight shield usually round and held extended from the body by one hand. An improvised shield is usually only effective as a small shield. Anyone with the light armor proficiency can use small shields.

* **Medium Shield.** A standard sized shield that is typically held close to the body with the off-hand and further supported by straps on the upper arm or shoulders. They often bear the heraldric arms of the wielder or a local lord. It is also the largest shield that can be effectively used while mounted. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use medium shields.

* **Large Shield.** A tall shield that is strapped to the forearm and supported by resting the bottom on the ground when not moving. It is frequently used on battlefields as a mobile piece of cover for archers or soldiers in a shield wall. Anyone with the heavy armor proficiency can also use large shields, however due to the **oversized** property it cannot be used while mounted and small creatures must use two hands when wielding it.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### Helms

Helms offer protection only when worn with an appropriate set of armor. Helms cover progressively more of the head and face the heavier they are while gradually reducing visibility and muffling sounds.
___

* **Cap.** Caps are lightweight helms that protect the crown and top of the head. They can be used by anyone with the light armor proficiency and can be added to any suit of light armor. Donning or removing a cap counts as interacting with an object and can be performed as part of movement. Caps are commonly issued to archers and low ranking foot soldiers.

* **Half Helm.** Half helms balance protection and visibility. They cover more of the head, neck, ears, and face, often including eye and nose guards or chain mail fringe, while leaving the lower portion of the face exposed. Peripheral vision and hearing is noticeably obstructed while wearing these types of helms. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use a half helm when combined with a suit of medium armor. It takes an Action to don or remove a half helm since they are secured in place by a chin strap. They are typically worn by warriors of significant rank.

* **Full Helm.** A full helm covers the entire head and often interlocks with a gorget for neck protection. These helms are pierced with small eye slots and breathing holes and sometimes include a visor. Donning or removing a full helm requires an action, but a visor can be raised or lowered as part of movement. When the visor is raised the helm acts as a half helm for purposes of AC and **occluding**. Full helms can be used effectively by anyone with the heavy armor proficiency when combined with a suit of heavy armor. Full helms come in a variety of styles and are often augmented with horsehair mohawks, wings, antlers, and other heraldic decorations. They are typically only worn by warlords and battle commanders.

## Customizing Items

In some cases it's okay to break the game balance guidelines above, especially when you want to create a unique and memorable item. On the other hand you might wish to run a low-tech campaign or equip your NPCs with primative gear.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

### High-quality Items

High-quality weapons and armor are rare, valuable, and highly sought after so their cost should reflect this. These items are expertly crafted and can be considered masterwork items, others are made of rare and wonderful materials that grant them special properties. High-quality items can have one or more of the following benefits above and beyond the stats of its base stats:

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

Low-quality items might be old and worn out, damaged in some way, poorly crafted, or made from primative or sub-standard materials. In any case, low-quality items have one or more of the following drawbacks:

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

#### Weapon

### Feats
___

* **Crossbow Expert.** It takes a Bonus Action rather than an Action to reload a **repeating** crossbow.

* **Grappler.** If you use the **Improved Grappling** optional rule then this feat grants Advantage on checks to restrain a grappled target. 

* **Heavily Armored.** Gain proficiency with large shields and full helms.

* **Heavy Armor Master.** You can ignore the **cumbersome** and **restricting** properties on heavy armor and the **occluding** property of full helms.

* **Shield Master.** You no longer suffer any drawbacks from the **oversized** properties on shields and can ignore it.


<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

### Optional Rules
___

* **Attunements by Level.** A character can attune to a number of items equal to their current Proficiency modifier. This replaces the static value of 3 and slowly ramps up over the career of the character from 2 to 6. Artificer's Superior Attunement Feature grants a +1 to this value. 

* **Awesome Points.** This replaces Inspiration. All characters receive 1 Awesome Point at the beginning of a session. Characters can be awarded more Awesome Points during play at the discretion of the DM. Actions that might merit an award include but are not limited to: portrayal of traits, bonds, ideals, flaws, and alignment, clever ideas, enjoyable storytelling, etc. There is no upper limit to the number of Awesome Points a character can have and they do not go away until used. You can use your Awesome Points to reroll a d20 roll you just made. If the original roll had Advantage or Disadvantage the reroll also has Advantage or Disadvantage. You may also spend your Awesome Point on behalf of an ally.

* **Charging Attack.** On the same turn when taking the Dash Action you can use a Bonus Action to make a single melee weapon attack or shove a creature at the end of your movement. If you use this variant rule and have the **Charger** feat you can make this attack or shove as a free action. Use this rule if you want combat to feel more dynamic and fast paced.

* **Close Combat.** While grappled a creature suffers Disadvantage with any weapon attack unless the weapon is natural or has the **light** property. Use this rule if you want to emphasize the difficulty of bringing large or heavy weapons to bear while having your movement hampered or encourage the use of the Grapple Action.

* **Deflect Adjacent Missiles.** Monks can use their Deflect Missiles ability if one of their allies is the target and within 5'. If they do not successfully block all the damage, any remaining damage is taken by the monk.

* **Delaying Initiative.** On the first round of combat after initiative has been determined and before you have taken your first turn you may choose to lower your initiative to any lower value after which this becomes your new initiative until a new initiative is called for.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page
___

* **Drop Prone as a Reaction.** In response to being targeted by an attack you can see you can use your Reaction to drop Prone. This can be effective against range attacks. If being prone would grant full cover it instead grants three-quarter cover for the triggering attack.

* **Flanking.** A coordinated attack from flanking positions is tactially advantageous. Although the Help Action is always an option in combat if you are Flanking with an ally you may perform the Help Action as a Reaction instead and can be triggered by the allies Attack. Flanking is defined by the rules described in the DMG, page 251, but does not grant Advantage automatically. This is a good option to add if your table misses tactical maneuvering on the battle field, but feel like the option presented in the DMG is too powerful. 

* **Gain Exhaustion at 0 HP.** Each time a character is brought to 0 HP, assuming they are not killed outright, they gain a level of Exhaustion. This represents receiving a grievous wound that lingers even if they are brought back to 1 or more HP. Exhaustion levels accumulate as usual and it is possible to die from Exhaustion by being dropped to 0 HP too many times. Use this option if you feel like falling in combat doesn't have realistic consequences.

* **Healer’s Kit Use and Spending Hit Dice.** In order to recover Hit Points by spending any number of Hit Dice during a Short Rest one charge of a Healer’s Kit must be spent on the character spending the Hit Dice. This represents using bandages, salves, and such to treat wounds. This restriction only applies to Hit Dice and not to features like Second Wind or any other sources of Healing

* **Improved Grappling.** While you have a creature grappled if you succeed on another grapple attack against the same target you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends. The **Grappler** feat grants advantage on this second grapple check. Anything that causes the grappled condition to end also ends the restrained condition.

* **Recharge on a 20.** If a magic item with charges has a chance to be destroyed when the last charge is used then it also has a chance to recharge as well. When the last charge is used roll a d20. If the result is a 1 the item is destroyed as normal, however if the result is a 20 then the item immediately regains charges as if it had regained charges on the following dawn. This rule rewards the characters for taking a chance on that last charge when the stakes are high.

* **Reduce Falling Damage.** While not incapacitated a character can reduce falling distance by making an Athletics or Acrobatics check and subtracting the result from the distance fallen. For example: a character falling 30 feet and rolls a 12 Athletics check is treated as only falling 18 feet and therefore takes only 1D6 bludgeoning damage from the fall. If the falling distance is reduced to less than 10 feet then the character takes no damage and is not prone.

* **Skill Checks as a Reaction.** Several skills can be used as a reaction to a specific cause. For example knowledge skills (Arcana, Nature, Religion, History) can be used as a reaction to identify something when first encountered, i.e. a creature as it attacks or spell as it is being cast. Perception can be used as a reaction to pinpoint a hidden creature’s location when it moves. Acrobatics can be used as a reaction to taking falling damage from being pushed or otherwise forcefully moved.

* **Taking Damage While Grappling.** When a creature that is grappling another target takes damage it must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or release the grapple. The DC is 10 or equal to the damage taken, whichever is greater, identical to a concentration check for maintaining a spell. Creatures that have special attacks that cause the grappled condition may automatically succeed on this check subject to the DM's ruling.

* **Untrained Help.** If you attempt the Help Action you must succeed at a DC/AC 10 check unless you are already proficient with the skill or weapon with which you are attempting to use. If you fail the check you grant disadvantage instead of advantage. Use this rule if you want to characters to emphasize their trained skills and want to avoid "piling on".
