# Armory Remix

A *street thug with club in hand sneaks up on an unsuspecting mark knowing that one quick strike to the back of the head will render his victim unconscious. Students listen intently to their weapons master as she instructs them on the finer points of spear fighting and how a quick change in grip can extend their reach to strike opponents at a distance. A veteran soldier, standing in formation shoulder to shoulder to green recruits, grits his teeth as he sets his pike to recieve the front ranks of the charging orc horde. With a flick of the wrist a bounty hunter wraps her whip around the ankles of a fleeing bounty enabling her to claim the full reward for bringing him in alive. A dual-wielding swordsman's quick flashing blades deter his enemies from trying to slip past him, while nearby his lightly armored halfling companion easily dodges past the slow and clumsy strikes of an ogre's greatclub.*

The 5th edition Player's Handbook presents a very streamlined and simplified equipment list. It serves as a fine starting point for most campaigns, but it lacks a certain amount of variety. This rules supplement presents new weapons, armor, shields and related properties inspired by previous editions to add flavor, provide interesting choices, and create meaningful distinctions between items. In addition to new items and properties there are rules on how to tweak items further to create custom high quality or low quality items and a list of updates to rules regarding proficincies and feats that deal with armor, shields, and weapons.

## Weapons

Weapons fall into certain groups based on how they are best used. Heavy weapons are slow but punishing when they connect and small hidden weapons can be suprisingly deadly when the target is distracted or unaware. Light blades excel at quick strikes, while larger blades cut deeply. Whips and chains can wrap around obstacles or even be used with some skill to entangle targets. Spear-like thrusting weapons are best at repelling charges and for use in the water. Applying the following new weapon properties helps to reinforce these ideas.

### New Weapon Properties

**Balanced.** A weapon with this property is particularly well-balanced or suited to exploiting tactical openings. You have Advantage on any attacks made as a reaction when using this weapon. One-handed double-edged swords of short to medium length and quarterstaves tend to be more **balanced** than other types of weapons. A **balanced** weapon cannot also be **slow**.


**Brutal.** These weapons rely on heavy mass or cruel spikes and barbs to deal higher than normal damage. If the result of any rolled weapon damage die is 1, reroll it and take the new result instead. This includes any additional weapon damage dice provided by a critical hit, but does not include sneak attack damage dice, additional damage dice provided by spells, or other sources. This benefit is lost against targets wearing **durable** armor. Impaling, crushing, and **heavy** weapons tend to also be **brutal**. A **brutal** weapon cannot also be **light**, **finesse**, or **feeble**.


**Feeble.** A weapon with this property is weak, poorly crafted, or made of sub-standard materials like stone, bone, or bronze. In any case it deals less damage than other types of weapons. If the result of any weapon damage die is its max value, reroll it and take the new result. Agricultural tools, improvised weapons, ceremonial weapons, or old and damaged weapons tend to be **feeble**. A **feeble** weapon cannot also be **brutal**. 


**Flexible.** A weapon with this property consists of multiple interlocking rigid parts or made entirely of a flexible material like rope or leather. Due to it's flexible nature it can neutralize the benefits of shields and cover. As long as the attacker can see the target in range an attack made with this weapon ignores any AC bonuses from shields, any benefits of half cover, and reduces three-quarter cover to half cover instead. Whips, chains, and flails are all **flexible** weapons.


**Grappling.** These weapons are made from entangling cords, chains, nets, or have special hooks designed for grabbing and can be used to make a grappling attack instead of doing damage. Using a weapon in this way does not require you to have a free hand. You make a melee or ranged weapon attack roll in place of a STR (Athletics) check and in all other ways works the same as a normal grappling attack. To maintain a grapple with this weapon you must keep at least one hand on it. **Grappling** weapons tend to also be **flexible** and **monk** weapons, but aren't required to be either.


**High Crit.** These weapons deal unusually large amounts of damage on a critical hit due to their sharp blades or long spikes. Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon maximize the base damage and then roll any extra crit damage dice normally. This feature is nullified by targets wearing **tough** armor. Chopping weapons like axes, single edged swords, and impaling weapons like picks tend to be **high crit** weapons.


**Lunging.** Some one-handed weapons are long and light enough to be used to sacrifice power to gain reach. When making a reach attack with a **lunging** weapon use the lower damage die listed in parentheses. You cannot use this feature while holding the weapon in both hands. A **lunging** weapon is typically not also **heavy** or **two-handed**.


**Monk.** Weapons with this property count as Monk weapons that can be used with the Martial Arts feature (PHB pg.78). **Monk** weapons tend to be simple weapons without the **heavy** or **two-handed** properties, however there are a few select martial weapons that are specifically included.


**Oversized.** This weapon is larger and heavier than other **versatile** weapons and difficult to use properly without exceptional strength. If you do not meet minimum Strength requirement in the parentheses it loses the **versatile** property and gains the **two-handed** property instead and cannot be used in one hand.


**Powerdraw.** Especially powerful bows made from reinforced, rare, or composite materials derive their damage from the increased strength necessary to pull it. When applied to a shortbow or longbow this property allows you to use your Strength modifier for attack and damage bonuses in place of Dexterity. The weapon cannot be used if the minimum Strength requirement in parentheses is not met. **Powerdraw** bows are rare and valuable.


**Reapeating.** When applied to a crossbow of any type this property replaces the loading property of that weapon when used with a magazine that still has ammunition in it. The typical magazine holds up to 6 bolts. Reloading a repeating crossbow takes an action. 


**Set.** A weapon with this property is highly effective when properly used against charging opponents. When you use a readied action to attack a target  that has moved at least 15' toward you with this weapon that attack has Advantage and if it hits treat the hit as a critical hit. Spear-like piercing weapons tend to have the **set** property.


**Slow.** These weapons are unbalanced, heavy, or cumbersome making them too slow to recover after swinging. Therefore any attack made as a reaction with this weapon has Disadvantage. **Heavy** and **two-handed** weapons tend to be **slow**. A **slow** weapon cannot also be **balanced**.


**Sneaky.** This weapon is especially dangerous when used during a suprise strike. If you hit with this weapon and had Advantage with the attack, treat the hit as a critical hit. It can also be used with a Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, if not already allowed. **Sneaky** weapons tend to be simple, small, silent, and easily concealable. 


**Underwater.** A weapon with this property can be used underwater without Disadvantage (PHB pg. 198). **Underwater** weapons tend to be piercing and thrusting weapons.

### New Weapons

**Bastard Sword.** A double-edged sword with a wide crossguard and an extended pommel. Longer than a longsword but shorter than a greatsword.

**Bolas.** Two or three weights connected by cords that when spun and thrown entangle their target.

**Broadsword.** A sword with wide blade with very little taper and a one-handed pommel. The length is about midway between a shortsword and a longsword.

**Chain.** A long length of interlocking metal loops with a weight on each end.

**Fullblade.** A rare and impractically massive sword with an oversized blade, about as long a greatsword, but wider. It has a counter-balanced pommel which allows only the exceptionally strong to wield it in one hand.

**Heavy Flail.** A larger and heavier version of the flail intended to be used with two hands.

**Heavy pick.** A larger and heavier version of the warpick intended to be used with two hands.

**Khopesh.** An exotic-looking axe-like sword with an outwardly curving blade.

**Lasso.** A length of rope tied into a loop or noose that can be thrown around a target to restraint it.

**Light Flail.** Two short sections of wood or metal connected by a small chain or hinge. Originally intended as an agricultural tool for threshing grain.

**Longspear.** Longer than a normal spear, reaching lengths of 8' to 10'.

**Lucern Hammer.** A hammer with a spike on the other side mounted on a long pole.

**Man Catcher.** A cage-like ring of inwardly pointing barbs mounted on the end of a long pole. Intended to be used to unhorse riders and capture targets rather than kill them.

**Pick.** A small double-headed pick usually used for breaking up dirt or rocks.

**Pitchfork.** Your standard pitchfork, two or more prongs on a long wooded handle.

**Scourge.** A short lash with multiple thongs typically made of leather and usually used as a form of torture.

**Scythe.** A sharp inwardly curved blade attached to a long wooden handle intended for shearing grain.

**Shovel.** A digging tool with a metal head on a long wooden handle.

**Throwing Knife.** A small sharp blade specially shaped and balanced for accurate throwing.

**Waraxe.** An oversized one-handed axe, larger than a battleaxe, but smaller than a greataxe. The **dwarven axe** is another example.

**Warpick.** A larger and more dangerous version of the pick able to be used in one or two hands. Sometimes called a **horseman's pick**.

**Warspear.** A sturdy oversized spear with a heavy tip that can be used in one hand by the very strong.

## Armor and Shields

Just as some weapons pose new threats, the right kind of armor can neutralize those threats. Likewise a shield is not only useful in deflecting blows in close combat, but a sufficiently large shield when used properly can offer a much needed source of cover from explosions, magical blasts, and bursts of dragon's breath. The following are a few new properties along with new options for armor and shields with their own benefits and drawbacks.

### New Armor and Shield Properties

**Covering.** Shields with the **covering** property can be treated as cover while crouching behind it. When prone medium shields provide half-cover and heavy shields provide three-quarter cover to the creature using it, assuming the shield is apropriately sized for the creature in question. Light shields do not provide any cover. Take only the AC bonus from the shield or cover condition depending on how it's being used, but not both.

**Cumbersome.** Armor with this property weighs the wearer down and can slow movement. The wearer must meet the minimum STR requirement in the parenthese or have their base movement speed be reduced by 10' while wearing this armor.

**Durable.** This armor provides additional protection and cushioning against heavy hitting impacts from **brutal** weapons, effectively allowing the wearer to ignore that property. All damage from **brutal** weapons is rolled normally.

**Obscuring.** This armor includes a helmet that partially obscures your vision and hearing. All Wisdom (Perception) checks are made at Disadvantage while wearing this armor.

**Restrictive.** Armor with this property restricts the full range of motion, making it difficult to move quickly and quietly. The wearer has Disadvantage with Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wearing this armor.

**Spiked.** Armor and shields with this property have been embellished with intimidating metal spikes or something equally dangerous. A shield with spikes does 1d4 piercing damage instead of bludgeoning when used as a weapon or as part of a shove attack. A creature who grapples or is grappled by another creature in spiked armor takes 1d4 piercing damage from the spikes. Armor with spikes also gains the **restrictive** property if it doesn't already.

**Tough.** This armor is reinforced and covers the vital areas better making it harder to land deadly blows and allowing the wearer to ignore the **high crit** property of any weapons. Roll damage normally for a critical hit from any **high crit** weapons.

**Unwieldy.** Heavy shields are bulky and cumbersome and make it difficult to fight while carrying. All attack rolls are made at Disadvantage while carrying a large shield. 

```
```

### New Armor and Shields

**Banded.** Heavy armor made from overlapping horizontal plates of metal attached to a padded leather undertunic. Also known as **banded plate**, **banded mail**, or **laminar armor**.

**Brigandine.** An armored coat with small rigid plates sewn between layers of cloth. Grants more protection than other light armors, but is heavier and a bit more restrictive as a trade-off. Also known as a **coat of plates** or **jack of plates**

**Breastplate, Half Plate, Field Plate, and Full Plate.** These armors consists of interlocking plates covering various parts of the body and chainmail protecting the joints. Breastplates just cover the vital areas of the torso. Half plate adds pauldrons and vambraces while field plate includes greaves, gorget and half-helm. Full plate finally adds sabatons, guantlets, and a great helm along with other pieces sheathing the entire body. It is possible to start with a breastplate and then slowly add the other pieces until you make it a full suit of plate armor.

**Heavy Shield.** A very large and heavy shield, sometimes as tall as 5', most often made of metal with a groove in the middle to help it stand upright when placed on the ground. A heavy shield can be set on the ground as an action and used as cover until picked up again with another action. Most often used on battlefields as a mobile piece of cover for soldiers and especially archers. Anyone with the heavy armor proficiency can also use heavy shields. Also known as a **pavise**, **mantlet**, **body**, or **tower** shield.

**Light Shield.** A small round shield usually made of wood or leather and possibly with metal rivets for reinforcement. Anyone with the light armor proficiency can use a light shield. Sometimes known as a **targe**, **target**, **round shield**, or **buckler**.

**Medium Shield.** A standard shield usually made of metal, or wood with metal reinforcement. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use medium shields. Examples include **scutum**, **heater**, and **kite** shields.

**Splint.** Heavy armor made from vertical metal ribs, or splints, attached to a backing of leather with chainmail covering the joints. Also known as **splint mail** or **splinted plate**.

### Customizing Items

When creating your own weapons and armor or customizing existing here are a few guidelines that will help to keep things balanced:

* Simple weapons tend to do less damage and have fewer beneficial keywords than Martial weapons. 
* Common tools and farming implements also can be used as Simple weapons.
* Light weapons tend to do low damage since they can be used in the off-hand for a bonus attack.
* Finesse weapons tend to do low damage as well since they can be used in conjunction with Sneak Attack.
* Light and Finesse weapons should not also be Heavy.
* Reach and Two-handed weapons tend to be Heavy.
* Thrown weapons have a maximum range which is 3x its short range.
* Ammunition weapons have a maximum range which is 4x its short range.
* Heavy armor tends to be both restrictive and cumbersome.
* Avoid the temptation to add inherent attack, damage, or AC bonuses.

### High Quality Items

In some cases it's okay to break the game balance guidelines above, especially when you want to create a unique and memorable item. High quality weapons are rare, valuable, and highly sought after so their cost should reflect this. These items are expertly crafted and can be considered masterwork items, others are made of rare and wonderful materials that grant them special properties. High quality items can have one or more of the following benefits above and beyond the stats of its base stats:

#### Weapons
* Add the **high crit** or **brutal** property
* Add the **finesse** or **light** property or remove **heavy** property
* Add the **balanced** property or remove the **slow** property
* Add the **powerdraw** property to a shortbow or longbow or add the **repeating** property to a crossbow
* Remove the **oversized** property
* Reduce STR requirement for **brutal** or **oversized** weapons

#### Armor or Shield
* Add the **durable**, **tough**, or **spiked** property
* Remove the **restrictive**, **unwieldy**, or **cumbersome** property
* Reduce the STR requirement for the **cumbersome** property
* Reduce the weight of the armor or shield

### Low Quality Items

On the other hand you might wish to run a low-tech campaign or equip your monsters with primative gear. Low quality items might be old and worn out, damaged in some way, poorly crafted, or made from primative or sub-standard materials such as bronze, bone, stone, or wood. In any case, low quality items have one or more of the following drawbacks:

#### Weapon
* Add the **feeble** property or remove either the **high crit** or **brutal** property
* Add the **heavy** property or remove either the **light** or **finesse** property
* Add the **slow** property or remove the **balanced** property
* Add the **oversized** property if the weapon is **versatile**
* Increase the **brutal** STR requirement for **brutal** or **oversized** weapons

#### Armor or Shield
* Remove the **durable**, **tough**, or **spiked** property
* Add the **restrictive**, **cumbersome**, or **unwieldy** property
* Increase the STR requirement for the **cumbersome** property
* Increase the weight of the armor or shield
