### Simple Melee Weapons

Simple melee weapons are easily made or improvised from tools on hand. Commoners frequently have a access to a dagger, club, quarterstaff, or farming implements while militia and guards are often equipped with a mace or spear. Savage humanoids often wield clubs, great clubs, and javelins due their simple construction.


**Axe.** A small light-weight single-edged chopping axe. A common tool among settlers in forested climates it is also useful as a weapon or thrown missile in a pinch.

**Club and Great Club.** A bludgeon made of wood, bone, stone, or even a leather stack filled with sand or rocks. Clubs are rarely crafted and are often improvised from objects on hand. A regular club is a small one-handed weapons while a great club is a larger two-handed weapon. Clubs and great clubs are favored among brutish humanoids and less intelligent giants.

**Dagger.** A small one-handed stabbing or slashing weapon that comes in a variety of shapes and styles. Traditional daggers have a flat and wide pointed blade while stilettos have a long and narrow blade. Knives generally have a single edged blade for slashing and cutting. Daggers can be wielded in either hand, thrown, and used in close combat making them a very useful backup or secondary weapon.

**Flail.** Two short sections of wood or metal connected by a small chain or hinge. Originally intended as a tool for threshing grain it can be used as a flexible bludgeoning weapon as well.

**Hammer.** A one-handed hammer useful as a hand tool, a bludgeon, or a throwing weapon. A favorite skirmishing weapon among dwarves, gnomes, and other mining races.

**Javelin.** A short spear primarily meant as a throwing weapon but can be used as a one-handed stabbing weapon as well. Cheap and easily fabricated, it is a common weapon among tribal humanoids and frequently issued to foot soldiers as a skirmishing weapon.

**Lasso.** A length of rope tied into a loop, slip knot, or noose that can be thrown around a target to restraint it. It takes two hands to properly control a lasso. It doesn't cause any damage directly but can be used to grapple, restrain, and possibly strangle a target.

**Mace.** A one-handed bludgeon specifically crafted as a weapon often having a heavy rounded or flanged head to increase the impact. Simple maces are issued to civil peace-keeping forces for protection and as a symbol of authority.

**Pick.** A small one-handed pick usually used for breaking up dirt or rocks but also useful for piercing flesh.

**Quarter Staff.** A rod of wood, or rarely metal, between four and six feet long, usually as tall as the wielder, that can be wielded as a weapon in one or two hands. A very common weapon among peasants, pilgrims, and monks for its versatility and simple craftsmanship.

**Scythe.** A sharp inwardly curved blade attached to a long wooden handle primarily intended for shearing grasses and grain. Can only be properly wielded with two hands.

**Shovel.** A digging tool with a wide flat metal blade mounted on a four foot long wooden handle. Not an ideal weapon, but it can be useful as an improvised weapon.

**Sickle.** A small inwardly curved blade mounted on a short handle, basically a one-handed scythe and used in the collection of herbs and clearing of weeds. Similar to a machete, which has a single edged blade and used to chop away brush and debris. 

**Spear and Long Spear.** Spears are one of the earliest weapons invented by intelligent humanoids and still in wide-spread use. Spears are basically a staff sharpened on one end, tipped with a sharpened metal spearhead, or fashion with a number of prongs in the case of a trident or pitchfork. Spears can be used in a variety of ways and are very effective when braced against a charge. A long spear is longer than a normal spear, reaching lengths of up to 8', and requiring two hands to wield effectively.

**Unarmed Strike.** All humanoids can perform an unarmed strike as an Attack action. It can represent a punch, kick, knee, headbutt, tail slam, shoulder throw, or any other brawling move.


### Simple Range Weapons

Simple range weapons are typically used for hunting but can be used in battle when needed. Commoners often own a sling or a short bow while militia and town guards are frequently equipped with light crossbows.


**Dart.** A dart is a small specialized throwing weapon, similar to an arrow, with a short shaft, fletching, and a weighted head. It can also be used as ammunititon for the **dart thrower** which extends the range and power of the dart.

**Light Crossbow and Repeating Light Crossbow.** A small mechanical bow mounted horizontally onto a wooden stock which fires bolts when a trigger is depressed. The bow must be reset and bolts must be loaded individually between shots. A wall manned with guards equipped with light crossbows is an effective deterent. A **repeating** light crossbow has been modified to use a magazine of bolts which replaces the need to load after every shot.

**Net.** A grid of woven and knotted rope or vines meant to entrap and entangle other creatures. It causes no direct damage but imposes the Restrained condition on a target it hits. A net has no effect on a creature that is formless, Huge, or larger. The net can be cut by doing 5 points of slashing damage to it (AC 10), effectively freeing a captured creature. Being a thrown weapon with a very short range it suffers from Disadvantage in most cases, unless you have a special feat or other source of Advantage to cancel it out. 

**Short Bow and Recurve Short Bow.** A short bow is a small bow that is meant for short range or can be used while mounted. A recurve short bow is shaped with additional curves to increase its range and adds the **powerdraw** property and are often crafted of composited materials to add spring and resilience to the bow.

**Sling.** A sling is a simple leather thong with a pouch use for hurling stones or metal bullets. It is a common weapon among shepherds and other common folk and can be easily stored in a pouch along with stones and bullets.
