### Martial Range Weapons

Martial range weapons require more training and practice than simple range weapons in order to use them effectively. Trained assassins use blowguns, throwing knives, and hand crossbows while military marksmen typically use long bows and heavy crossbows. Martial range weapons tend to have longer ranges and deal more damage than their simple range weapon counterparts, while costing more and being less common.


**Blowgun.** A long hollow tube with a mouth piece meant for firing small darts, often poisoned. A favored weapon among jungle tribes and assassins.

**Bolas.** Two or three weights connected by cords that when spun and thrown entangle their target.

**Dart Thrower.** A specialized tool for hurling **darts** further and harder than possible if thrown. Typically a length of wood roughly the length of the thrower's forearm with a notch at one end that hooks into the back of a dart. These are used by tribal humanoids that may not have access to bows or lack the size and strength to use other thrown weapons.

**Hand Crossbow or Repeating Hand Crossbow.** A small light one-handed version of a crossbow that fires small bolts. One of the few ranged weapons that can be used in an off-hand. A repeating hand crossbow has been modified to use a magazine which removes the **loading** property. Hand crossbows are a favored weapon among Drow.

**Heavy Crossbow.** A heavier version of a crossbow equipped with a stirrup or hand crank to make loading easier. Due to the force required to draw the bow it is unlikely to find a repeating heavy crossbow. Heavy crossbows are **heavy** and are difficult to use while mounted.

**Long Bow or Recurve Long Bow.** A tall bow that takes significant training and practice to use effectively. Long bows can also be recurved or made of composite materials to increase their range and power even more. Long bows are **heavy** and are difficult to use while mounted.

**Staff Sling.** A sling mounted on a short staff which is used as a fulcrum to hurl stones and bullets much farther and faster than normally possible. The staff portion of the weapon can also be used in melee as a two-handed bludgeoning weapon if necessary.

**Throwing Knife.** A small sharp blade specially shaped and balanced for accurate throwing. Sometimes double-ended or shaped like a star so that it strikes with a sharp edge no matter how it hits. Smaller and easier to conceal than a dagger throwing knives are favored by spies and assassins.
