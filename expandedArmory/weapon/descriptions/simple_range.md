### Simple Range Weapons

Simple range weapons are typically used for hunting but can be used in battle when needed. Commoners often own a sling or a short bow while militia and town guards are frequently equipped with light crossbows.

___
* **Dart.** A dart is a small specialized throwing weapon, similar to an arrow, with a short shaft, fletching, and a weighted head. It can also be used as ammunititon for the **dart thrower** which extends the range and power of the dart.

* **Light Crossbow and Repeating Light Crossbow.** A small mechanical bow mounted horizontally onto a wooden stock which fires bolts when a trigger is depressed. The bow must be reset and bolts must be loaded individually between shots. A wall manned with guards equipped with light crossbows is an effective deterent. A **repeating** light crossbow has been modified to use a magazine of bolts which replaces the need to load after every shot.

* **Net.** A grid of woven and knotted rope or vines meant to entrap and entangle other creatures. It causes no direct damage but imposes the Restrained condition on a target it hits. A net has no effect on a creature that is formless, Huge, or larger. The net can be cut by doing 5 points of slashing damage to it (AC 10), effectively freeing a captured creature. Being a thrown weapon with a very short range it suffers from Disadvantage in most cases, unless you have a special feat or other source of Advantage to cancel it out. 

* **Short Bow and Recurve Short Bow.** A short bow is a small bow that is meant for short range or can be used while mounted. A recurve short bow is shaped with additional curves to increase its range and adds the **powerdraw** property and are often crafted of composited materials to add spring and resilience to the bow.

* **Sling.** A sling is a simple leather thong with a pouch use for hurling stones or metal bullets. It is a common weapon among shepherds and other common folk and can be easily stored in a pouch along with stones and bullets.
