## Weapons

Weapons are distinquished by a set of properties that describe how they perform in battle. Large weapons are slow and unbalanced. Small hidden weapons can be suprisingly deadly in the right hands. Chopping blades cut deeply and heavy bludgeons deliver crushing blows. Whips and chains can wrap around obstacles or even be used with some skill to entangle targets. Spear-like thrusting weapons are best at repelling charges and for use in the water. 

The following weapon properties and their effects reinforce these ideas. Several of the weapon properties require proficiency in the weapon in order to gain their benefits. In some cases they replace existing table elements defined in the PHB.
