### New Weapon Properties

**Brace.** These weapons are more effective when braced and set against a charge. Any Readied Attack Action against an advancing opponent has Advantage. Brace weapons tend to be **two-handed** or **versatile** piercing weapons, like spears and pikes. Brace weapons can not also be **mounted**.


**Brutal.** These weapons create deep vicious wounds that tend to bleed. If the result of any rolled weapon damage die is 1, reroll it and take the new result instead. This includes any additional critical hit dice, but does not include dice provided by sneak attack, spells or other features. This property is negated by **hardened** armor. Axes and other curved slashing weapons tend to have the brutal property. 


**Crushing.** These weapons rely on heavy mass to deliver staggering blows. Critical hits Shove the target using the damage rolled as the DC. Crushing weapons tend to be bludgeoning, **heavy**, or **slow**. Crushing weapons can not also be **light** or **finesse**.


**High Crit.** These weapons deal higher than normal damage on a critical hit due to cruel spikes or barbs that pierce armor and strike at vital organs.
Add 1 additional weapon damage die when rolling crit damage. This feature is negated by targets wearing **hardened** armor. Impaling weapons like picks tend to be **high crit** weapons. Impaling weapons like picks and spears tend to be **high crit**.


**Weak.** A weapon with this property is feeble, poorly crafted, or made of sub-standard materials like stone, bone, or bronze. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll this weapon becomes broken. Tools, improvised, ceremonial, low-quality, or old weapons do not stand up to abuse and are prone to breaking and tend to be **weak**.


**Flexible.** A weapon with this property consists of multiple interlocking rigid parts or made entirely of a flexible material like rope or leather. Due to it's flexible nature it can neutralize the benefits of shields and cover. As long as the attacker can see the target in range an attack made with this weapon ignores any AC bonuses from shields, any benefits of half cover, and reduces three-quarter cover to half cover instead. Whips, chains, and flails are all **flexible** weapons.
Whips, Chains, and Flails are all flexible


**Grappling.** These weapons are made from entangling cords, chains, nets, or have special hooks designed for grabbing and can be used to make a grappling attack instead of doing damage. Using a weapon in this way does not require you to have a free hand. You make a melee or ranged weapon attack roll in place of a STR (Athletics) check and in all other ways works the same as a normal grappling attack. To maintain a grapple with this weapon you must keep at least one hand on it. **Grappling** weapons tend to also be **flexible** and **monk** weapons, but aren't required to be either.


**Lunging.** Some one-handed weapons are long and light enough to be used to sacrifice power to gain reach. When making a reach attack with a **lunging** weapon use the lower damage die listed in parentheses. You cannot use this feature while holding the weapon in both hands. A **lunging** weapon is typically not also **heavy** or **two-handed**.


**Monk.** Weapons with this property count as Monk weapons that can be used with the Martial Arts feature (PHB pg.78). **Monk** weapons tend to be simple weapons without the **heavy** or **two-handed** properties, however there are a few select martial weapons that are specifically included.


**Oversized.** This weapon is larger and heavier than other **versatile** weapons and difficult to use properly without exceptional strength. If you do not meet minimum Strength requirement in the parentheses it loses the **versatile** property and gains the **two-handed** property instead and cannot be used in one hand.


**Powerdraw.** Especially powerful bows made from reinforced, rare, or composite materials derive their damage from the increased strength necessary to pull it. When applied to a shortbow or longbow this property allows you to use your Strength modifier for attack and damage bonuses in place of Dexterity. The weapon cannot be used if the minimum Strength requirement in parentheses is not met. **Powerdraw** bows are rare and valuable.


**Reapeating.** When applied to a crossbow of any type this property replaces the loading property of that weapon when used with a magazine that still has ammunition in it. The typical magazine holds up to 6 bolts. Reloading a repeating crossbow takes an action. 


**Set.** A weapon with this property is highly effective when properly used against charging opponents. When you use a readied action to attack a target  that has moved at least 15' toward you with this weapon that attack has Advantage and if it hits treat the hit as a critical hit. Spear-like piercing weapons tend to have the **set** property.


**Slow.** These weapons are unbalanced, heavy, or cumbersome making them too slow to recover after swinging. Therefore any attack made as a reaction with this weapon has Disadvantage. **Heavy** and **two-handed** weapons tend to be **slow**. A **slow** weapon cannot also be **balanced**.


**Sneaky.** This weapon is especially dangerous when used during a suprise strike. If you hit with this weapon and had Advantage with the attack, treat the hit as a critical hit. It can also be used with a Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, if not already allowed. **Sneaky** weapons tend to be simple, small, silent, and easily concealable. 


**Underwater.** A weapon with this property can be used underwater without Disadvantage (PHB pg. 198). **Underwater** weapons tend to be piercing and thrusting weapons.



Sneaky -  this weapon is especially effective when used to strike a distracted or unaware foe. If you hit with this weapon and had advantage with the attack, use the higher damage die listed. It can also be used with a sneak attack if not already allowed.

Reach - this weapon can target and threaten creatures up to 10' away, but is suffers from disadvantage on attacks made within 5'. The Polearm master feat negates this disadvantage. Polearms, whips, and chains tend to be reach weapons

Slow - this weapon is too slow, heavy, or awkward to use quickly, granting disadvantage to any attacks made as a reaction. This includes opportunity attacks and readied attacks

Flexible - flexible weapons can be used to wrap around obstacles to strike targets. attacks with this weapon ignore up to +2 AC bonus granted by shields or cover

Grappling - weapon can be used to make a Grapple Attack instead of doing damage. Use the weapon's range and attack modifiers instead of a STR (Athletics) check.

Underwater - can be used underwater without disadvantage (from PHB)

Composite - can add STR modifier to damage instead of DEX.

Monk - unarmed strikes, any simple melee weapons without heavy or two-handed keywords, and short swords are considered monk weapons (from PHB).

Lunging - can be treated as a one-handed reach weapon, but does less damage beyond 5', use the lower damage die.


Powerdraw - when applied to a shortbow or longbow this allows you to use your strength modifier for damage bonus instead of dexterity

Reapeating - when applied to a crossbow of any type this allows you to ignore the loading property of the that weapon when used with an appropriate magazine that still has ammunition in it. The size of the magazine supported is listed in parenthesis. Loading a new magazine takes an action.
