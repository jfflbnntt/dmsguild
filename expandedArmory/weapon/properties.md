### Weapon Properties

Weapons are distinquished by a set of properties that govern how they perform in battle. The following lists these properties and their effects, including new and existing ones from the PHB and how they interact with each other along with suggestions on how they should be applied to new or customized weapons.

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged Attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you Attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the Attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee Attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Ammunition weapons have a maximum range which is 4x its short range.

**Brace.** These weapons are more effective when braced and set against charging opponents. Any Readied Attack Action against an advancing opponent has Advantage. Brace weapons tend to be **two-handed** or **versatile** piercing weapons, like spears and pikes. Brace weapons should not also have the **slow** property.

**Brutal.** These weapons create deep vicious wounds that tend to bleed. If the result of any rolled weapon damage die is 1, reroll it and take the new result instead. This includes any additional critical hit dice, but does not include dice provided by sneak attack, spells or other features. This property is negated by **hardened** armor. Axes and other curved slashing weapons tend to have the brutal property. 

**Crushing.** These weapons rely on heavy mass to deliver staggering blows. Critical hits Shove the target using the damage rolled as the DC. Crushing weapons tend to be bludgeoning, **heavy**, or **slow**. Crushing weapons can not also be **light** or **finesse**.

**Finesse.** When making an Attack with a **finesse** weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the Attack and Damage Rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Finesse weapons tend to do less damage than non-finesse weapons because they can be used with Sneak Attack. Finesse weapons tend to not be **heavy**, **slow**, or **two-handed**. Finesse weapons tend to do low damage since they can be used in conjunction with Sneak Attack.

**Flexible.** A weapon with this property consists of multiple interlocking rigid parts or made entirely of a flexible material like rope or leather. Due to it's flexible nature it can neutralize the benefits of shields and cover. As long as the attacker can see the target in range an attack made with this weapon ignores up to +2 AC bonus granted by shields or cover. Whips, chains, and flails are all **flexible** weapons.

**Grappling.** These weapons are made from entangling cords, chains, nets, or have special hooks designed for grabbing and can be used to make a grappling attack instead of doing damage. Using a weapon in this way does not require you to have a free hand. You make a melee or ranged weapon attack roll in place of a STR (Athletics) check and in all other ways works the same as a normal grappling attack. To maintain a grapple with this weapon you must keep at least one hand on it. **Grappling** weapons tend to also be **flexible** and **monk** weapons, but aren't required to be either.

**Heavy.** Small creatures have Disadvantage on Attack rolls with **heavy** weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a small creature to use effectively. Heavy weapons tend to be **slow** and **two-handed**.

**High Crit.** These weapons deal higher than normal damage on a critical hit due to cruel spikes or barbs that pierce armor and strike at vital organs.
Add 1 additional weapon damage die when rolling crit damage. This feature is negated by targets wearing **hardened** armor. Impaling weapons like picks tend to be **high crit** weapons. Impaling weapons like picks and spears tend to be **high crit**.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two Weapons. Light weapons tend to do less damage to balance out that they can be used in the off-hand. Light weapons should not also be **heavy**, **two-handed**, or **slow**. Light weapons tend to often be **finesse** and **sneaky**. Light weapons tend to do low damage since they can be used in the off-hand for a bonus attack.

**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. A **loading** weapon should not also have the **repeating** property.

**Lunging.** Some one-handed weapons are long and light enough to be used to sacrifice power to gain reach. When making a reach attack with a **lunging** weapon use the lower damage die listed in parentheses. You cannot use this feature while holding the weapon in both hands. A **lunging** weapon is typically not also **heavy**, **reach**, or **two-handed**.

**Monk.** Weapons with this property count as Monk weapons that can be used with the Martial Arts feature. **Monk** weapons tend to be simple weapons without the **heavy** or **two-handed** properties, however there are a few select martial weapons that are specifically included.

**Mounted.** Lances are most effective when used while mounted. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted. Mounted weapons tend to also be **slow** and **reach** weapons.

**Oversized.** Oversized weapons suffer Disadvantage on attack rolls when used while mounted. Heavy two-handed reach weapons tend to be oversized.

**Powerdraw.** Especially powerful bows are constructed of reinforced, rare, or composite materials while others are recurved. These bows derive their damage from the increased strength necessary to pull it. When applied to a short bow or long bow this property increases the range and allows you to use your Strength modifier for damage rolls in place of Dexterity. **Powerdraw** bows are rare and valuable.

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged Attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the Attack roll. You can’t Attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you Attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it. Polearms, two-handed weapons, whips, and chains all tend to be reach weapons. Reach weapons also tend to be **heavy** and **slow**.

**Reapeating.** When applied to a crossbow of any type this property replaces the loading property of that weapon when used with an appropriate magazine that still has ammunition in it. The typical magazine holds up to 6 bolts. Reloading a repeating crossbow takes an action. The Crossbow Expert Feat reduces the reload time to a Bonus Action.

**Slow.** These weapons are unbalanced, heavy, or too awkward to use quickly. Therefore any attack made as a Reaction with this weapon has Disadvantage. This includes opportunity attacks and readied attacks. Large **crushing**, **heavy** and **two-handed** weapons tend to be **slow**. A **slow** weapon should not have the **brace** property.

**Sneaky.** This weapon is especially dangerous when used to strike a distracted or unaware foe. If you hit with this weapon and had Advantage with the attack, use the higher damage die listed. It can also be used with a Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, if not already allowed. **Sneaky** weapons tend to be simple, small, silent, and easily concealable. They also tend to be low damaging. A sneaky weapon should not also have the **heavy**, **two-handed**, or **versatile** properties.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged Attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that Attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee Attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a hand axe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Thrown weapons are usually not **two-handed**, **heavy**, or **slow**. Thrown weapons have a maximum range which is 3x its short range.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands when you Attack with it. Weapons with the **two-handed** property tend to be **reach**, **slow** or **heavy**. Two-handed weapons should not be **light**, **finesse**, **lunging**, **monk**, or **versatile**.

**Underwater.** A weapon with this property can be used underwater without Disadvantage. **Underwater** weapons tend to be piercing and thrusting weapons.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property, the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack. Versatile weapons should not also be **two-handed** or **light**.

**Weak.** A weapon with this property is feeble, poorly crafted, or made of sub-standard materials like stone, bone, or bronze. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll this weapon becomes broken, and suffers Disadvantage to any further attacks. If you roll another 1 on an attack roll with a broken weapon it is destroyed and unusable. Improvised, practice, ceremonial, low-quality, or old weapons do not stand up to abuse and are prone to breaking and tend to be **weak**.
