### New Weapon Properties

**Balanced.** A weapon with this property is particularly well-balanced or suited to exploiting tactical openings. You have Advantage on any attacks made as a reaction when using this weapon. One-handed double-edged swords of short to medium length and quarterstaves tend to be more **balanced** than other types of weapons. A **balanced** weapon cannot also be **slow**.


**Brutal.** These weapons rely on heavy mass or cruel spikes and barbs to deal higher than normal damage. If the result of any rolled weapon damage die is 1, reroll it and take the new result instead. This includes any additional weapon damage dice provided by a critical hit, but does not include sneak attack damage dice, additional damage dice provided by spells, or other sources. This benefit is lost against targets wearing **durable** armor. Impaling, crushing, and **heavy** weapons tend to also be **brutal**. A **brutal** weapon cannot also be **light**, **finesse**, or **feeble**.


**Feeble.** A weapon with this property is weak, poorly crafted, or made of sub-standard materials like stone, bone, or bronze. In any case it deals less damage than other types of weapons. If the result of any weapon damage die is its max value, reroll it and take the new result. Agricultural tools, improvised weapons, ceremonial weapons, or old and damaged weapons tend to be **feeble**. A **feeble** weapon cannot also be **brutal**. 


**Flexible.** A weapon with this property consists of multiple interlocking rigid parts or made entirely of a flexible material like rope or leather. Due to it's flexible nature it can neutralize the benefits of shields and cover. As long as the attacker can see the target in range an attack made with this weapon ignores any AC bonuses from shields, any benefits of half cover, and reduces three-quarter cover to half cover instead. Whips, chains, and flails are all **flexible** weapons.


**Grappling.** These weapons are made from entangling cords, chains, nets, or have special hooks designed for grabbing and can be used to make a grappling attack instead of doing damage. Using a weapon in this way does not require you to have a free hand. You make a melee or ranged weapon attack roll in place of a STR (Athletics) check and in all other ways works the same as a normal grappling attack. To maintain a grapple with this weapon you must keep at least one hand on it. **Grappling** weapons tend to also be **flexible** and **monk** weapons, but aren't required to be either.


**High Crit.** These weapons deal unusually large amounts of damage on a critical hit due to their sharp blades or long spikes. Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon maximize the base damage and then roll any extra crit damage dice normally. This feature is nullified by targets wearing **tough** armor. Chopping weapons like axes, single edged swords, and impaling weapons like picks tend to be **high crit** weapons.


**Lunging.** Some one-handed weapons are long and light enough to be used to sacrifice power to gain reach. When making a reach attack with a **lunging** weapon use the lower damage die listed in parentheses. You cannot use this feature while holding the weapon in both hands. A **lunging** weapon is typically not also **heavy** or **two-handed**.


**Monk.** Weapons with this property count as Monk weapons that can be used with the Martial Arts feature (PHB pg.78). **Monk** weapons tend to be simple weapons without the **heavy** or **two-handed** properties, however there are a few select martial weapons that are specifically included.


**Oversized.** This weapon is larger and heavier than other **versatile** weapons and difficult to use properly without exceptional strength. If you do not meet minimum Strength requirement in the parentheses it loses the **versatile** property and gains the **two-handed** property instead and cannot be used in one hand.


**Powerdraw.** Especially powerful bows made from reinforced, rare, or composite materials derive their damage from the increased strength necessary to pull it. When applied to a shortbow or longbow this property allows you to use your Strength modifier for attack and damage bonuses in place of Dexterity. The weapon cannot be used if the minimum Strength requirement in parentheses is not met. **Powerdraw** bows are rare and valuable.


**Reapeating.** When applied to a crossbow of any type this property replaces the loading property of that weapon when used with a magazine that still has ammunition in it. The typical magazine holds up to 6 bolts. Reloading a repeating crossbow takes an action. 


**Set.** A weapon with this property is highly effective when properly used against charging opponents. When you use a readied action to attack a target  that has moved at least 15' toward you with this weapon that attack has Advantage and if it hits treat the hit as a critical hit. Spear-like piercing weapons tend to have the **set** property.


**Slow.** These weapons are unbalanced, heavy, or cumbersome making them too slow to recover after swinging. Therefore any attack made as a reaction with this weapon has Disadvantage. **Heavy** and **two-handed** weapons tend to be **slow**. A **slow** weapon cannot also be **balanced**.


**Sneaky.** This weapon is especially dangerous when used during a suprise strike. If you hit with this weapon and had Advantage with the attack, treat the hit as a critical hit. It can also be used with a Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, if not already allowed. **Sneaky** weapons tend to be simple, small, silent, and easily concealable. 


**Underwater.** A weapon with this property can be used underwater without Disadvantage (PHB pg. 198). **Underwater** weapons tend to be piercing and thrusting weapons.
