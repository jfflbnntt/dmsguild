### Simple Melee Weapons

Simple melee weapons are easily made or improvised from tools on hand. Commoners frequently have a access to a dagger, club, quarterstaff, or farming implements while militia and guards are often equipped with a mace or spear. Savage humanoids often wield clubs, great clubs, and javelins due their simple construction.


**Club.** A small one-handed bludgeon made of wood, bone, or even a leather stack filled with sand or rocks. Many improvised weapons can be considered clubs.

**Dagger.** A small one-handed stabbing or slashing weapon that comes in a variety of shapes and styles. Traditional daggers have a flat and wide pointed blade while stilettos have a long and narrow blade. Knives generally have a single edged blade for slashing and cutting. Daggers can be wielded in either hand, thrown, and used in close combat making them a very useful backup or secondary weapon.

**Great Club.** A two-handed club which can be made of wood, bone, stone, or even metal. Great clubs are often improvised from objects on hand, are rarely crafted, and commonly used by brutish humanoids.

**Hand Axe.** A small light-weight single-edged chopping axe. A common tool among settlers in forested climates it is also useful as a weapon or thrown missile in a pinch.

**Javelin.** A short spear primarily meant as a throwing weapon but can be used as a one-handed stabbing weapon as well. Cheap and easily fabricated, it is a common weapon among tribal humanoids and frequently issued to foot soldiers as a skirmishing weapon.

**Lasso.** A length of rope tied into a loop, slip knot, or noose that can be thrown around a target to restraint it. It takes two hands to properly control a lasso. It doesn't cause any damage directly but can be used to grapple, restrain, and possibly strangle a target.

**Light Flail.** Two short sections of wood or metal connected by a small chain or hinge. Originally intended as a tool for threshing grain it can be used as a flexible bludgeoning weapon as well.

**Light Hammer.** A one-handed hammer useful as a hand tool, a bludgeon, or a throwing weapon. A favorite skirmishing weapon among dwarves, gnomes, and other mining races.

**Light Pick.** A small one-handed pick usually used for breaking up dirt or rocks but also useful for piercing flesh.

**Long Spear.** Longer than a normal spear, reaching lengths of up to 8', and requiring two hands to wield effectively.

**Mace.** A one-handed bludgeon specifically crafted as a weapon often having a heavy rounded or flanged head to increase the impact. Simple maces are issued to civil peace-keeping forces for protection and as a symbol of authority.

**Quarter Staff.** A rod of wood, or rarely metal, between four and six feet long, usually as tall as the wielder, that can be wielded as a weapon in one or two hands. A very common weapon among peasants, pilgrims, and monks for its versatility and simple craftsmanship.

**Scythe.** A sharp inwardly curved blade attached to a long wooden handle primarily intended for shearing grasses and grain. Can only be properly wielded with two hands.

**Shovel.** A digging tool with a wide flat metal blade mounted on a four foot long wooden handle. Not an ideal weapon, but it can be useful as an improvised weapon.

**Sickle.** A small inwardly curved blade mounted on a short handle, basically a one-handed scythe and used in the collection of herbs and clearing of weeds. Similar to a machete, which has a single edged blade and used to chop away brush and debris. 

**Spear.** Spears are one of the earliest weapons invented by intelligent humanoids and still in wide-spread use. Spears are basically a quarter staff sharpened on one end, tipped with a sharpened metal spearhead, or fashion with a number of prongs in the case of a pitchfork. A spear can be used in a variety of ways and is very effective when braced against a charge.

**Unarmed Strike.** All humanoids can perform an unarmed strike as an Attack action. It can represent a punch, kick, knee, headbutt, tail slam, shoulder throw, or any other brawling move.


### Simple Range Weapons

Simple range weapons are typically used for hunting but can be used in battle when needed. Commoners often own a sling or a short bow while militia and town guards are frequently equipped with light crossbows.


**Dart.** A dart is a small specialized throwing weapon, similar to an arrow, with a short shaft, fletching, and a weighted head. It can also be used as ammunititon for the **dart thrower** which extends the range and power of the dart.

**Light Crossbow or Repeating Light Crossbow.** A small mechanical bow mounted horizontally onto a wooden stock which fires bolts when a trigger is depressed. The bow must be reset and bolts must be loaded individually between shots. A wall manned with guards equipped with light crossbows is an effective deterent. A **repeating** light crossbow has been modified to use a magazine of bolts which replaces the need to load after every shot.

**Net.** A grid of woven and knotted rope or vines meant to entrap and entangle other creatures. It causes no direct damage but imposes the Restrained condition on a target it hits. A net has no effect on a creature that is formless, Huge, or larger. The net can be cut by doing 5 points of slashing damage to it (AC 10), effectively freeing a captured creature. Being a thrown weapon with a very short range it suffers from Disadvantage in most cases, unless you have a special feat or other source of Advantage to cancel it out. 

**Short Bow or Recurve Short Bow.** A short bow is a small bow that is meant for short range or can be used while mounted. A recurve short bow is shaped with additional curves to increase its range and adds the **powerdraw** property and are often crafted of composited materials to add spring and resilience to the bow.

**Sling.** A sling is a simple leather thong with a pouch use for hurling stones or metal bullets. It is a common weapon among shepherds and other common folk and can be easily stored in a pouch.


### Martial Melee Weapons

Martial melee weapons are specialized to be wielded by trained warriors and soldiers. Common soldiers are typically outfitted with a polearm and a light one-handed weapon as a fallback, while commanders and elite soldiers tend to use versatile or great weapons. Martial melee weapons tend to do more damage and have more beneficial properties than their simple counterparts, yet the also cost more and aren't as readily available.


**Bastard Sword.** A double-edged sword with a wide crossguard and an extended pommel. Slightly longer than a long sword but not as large as a great sword, this is a fairly uncommon yet distinctive weapon. Also known as a claymore or hand-and-a-half sword.

**Battle Axe.** A battle axe is a long handled single-bladed axe that can be wielded in one or two hands. Also known as a war axe. Similar weapons include military cleavers and a khopseh, which is an exotic-looking axe-like sword with an outwardly curving blade.

**Broad Sword.** A sword with wide blade with very little taper and a one-handed pommel. The length is about midway between a shortsword and a longsword.

**Chain.** A chain is a length of interlocking metal loops or bars and weighted on the ends. It can be used like a whip or a flail to grapple opponents. Some chain weapons are spiked or have blades attached to the weighted ends.

### Martial Range Weapons

Martial range weapons require more training and practice than simple range weapons in order to use them effectively. Trained assassins use blowguns, throwing knives, and hand crossbows while military marksmen typically use long bows and heavy crossbows. Martial range weapons tend to have longer ranges and deal more damage than their simple range weapon counterparts, while costing more and being less common.


**Blowgun.** A long hollow tube with a mouth piece meant for firing small darts, often poisoned. A favored weapon among jungle tribes and assassins.

**Bolas.** Two or three weights connected by cords that when spun and thrown entangle their target.

**Dart Thrower.** A specialized tool for hurling **darts** further and harder than possible if thrown. Typically a length of wood roughly the length of the thrower's forearm with a notch at one end that hooks into the back of a dart. These are used by tribal humanoids that may not have access to bows or lack the size and strength to use other thrown weapons.

**Hand Crossbow or Repeating Hand Crossbow.** A small light one-handed version of a crossbow that fires small bolts. One of the few ranged weapons that can be used in an off-hand. A repeating hand crossbow has been modified to use a magazine which removes the **loading** property. Hand crossbows are a favored weapon among Drow.

**Heavy Crossbow.** A heavier version of a crossbow equipped with a stirrup or hand crank to make loading easier. Due to the force required to draw the bow it is unlikely to find a repeating heavy crossbow. Heavy crossbows are **oversized** and are difficult to use while mounted.

**Long Bow or Recurve Long Bow.** A tall bow that takes significant training and practice to use effectively. Long bows can also be recurved or made of composite materials to increase their range and power even more. Long bows are **oversized** and are difficult to use while mounted.

**Staff Sling.** A sling mounted on a short staff which is used as a fulcrum to hurl stones and bullets much farther and faster than normally possible. The staff portion of the weapon can also be used in melee as a one-handed bludgeoning weapon.

**Throwing Knife.** A small sharp blade specially shaped and balanced for accurate throwing.
