### Simple Melee Weapons

Simple melee weapons are easily made or improvised from tools on hand. Commoners frequently have a access to a dagger, club, quarterstaff, or farming implements while militia and guards are often equipped with a mace or spear. Savage humanoids often wield clubs, great clubs, and javelins due their simple construction.

**Club.** A small one-handed bludgeon made of wood, bone, or even a leather stack filled with sand or rocks. Most improvised weapons can be considered clubs.

**Dagger.** A small one-handed stabbing or slashing weapon that comes in a variety of shapes and styles. Traditional daggers have a flat and wide pointed blade while stilettos have a long and narrow blade. Knives generally have a single edged blade for slashing and cutting. Daggers can be wielded in either hand, thrown, and used in close combat making them a very useful backup or secondary weapon.

### Martial Melee Weapons

Martial melee weapons are specialized to be wielded by trained warriors and soldiers. Common soldiers are typically outfitted with a polearm and a light one-handed weapon as a fallback, while commanders and elite soldiers tend to use versatile or great weapons. Martial melee weapons tend to do more damage and have more beneficial properties than their simple counterparts, yet the also cost more and aren't as readily available.

**Bastard Sword.** A double-edged sword with a wide crossguard and an extended pommel. Longer than a longsword but shorter than a greatsword.

**Bolas.** Two or three weights connected by cords that when spun and thrown entangle their target.

**Broadsword.** A sword with wide blade with very little taper and a one-handed pommel. The length is about midway between a shortsword and a longsword.

**Chain.** A long length of interlocking metal loops with a weight on each end.

**Heavy pick.** A larger and heavier version of the warpick intended to be used with two hands.

### Martial Range Weapons

Martial range weapons require more training and practice than simple range weapons in order to use them effectively. Trained assassins use blowguns, throwing knives, and hand crossbows while military marksmen typically use long bows and heavy crossbows. Martial range weapons tend to have longer ranges and deal more damage than their simple range weapon counterparts, while costing more and being less common.
