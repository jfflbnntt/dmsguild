### Simple Melee Weapons

Simple melee weapons are easily made or improvised from tools on hand. Commoners frequently have a access to a dagger, club, quarterstaff, or farming implements while militia and guards are often equipped with a mace or spear. Savage humanoids often wield clubs, great clubs, and javelins due their simple construction.

**Club.** A small one-handed bludgeon made of wood, bone, or even a leather stack filled with sand or rocks. Many improvised weapons can be considered clubs.

**Dagger.** A small one-handed stabbing or slashing weapon that comes in a variety of shapes and styles. Traditional daggers have a flat and wide pointed blade while stilettos have a long and narrow blade. Knives generally have a single edged blade for slashing and cutting. Daggers can be wielded in either hand, thrown, and used in close combat making them a very useful backup or secondary weapon.

**Great Club.** A two-handed club which can be made of wood, bone, stone, or even metal. Great clubs are often improvised from objects on hand, are rarely crafted, and commonly used by brutish humanoids.

**Hand Axe.** A small light-weight single-edged chopping axe. A common tool among settlers in forested climates it is also useful as a weapon or thrown missile in a pinch.

**Javelin.** A light spear primarily meant as a throwing weapon but can be used as a stabbing weapon as well. Cheap and easily fabricated, it is a common weapon among tribal humanoids and frequently issued to foot soldiers as a skirmishing weapon.

**Lasso.** A length of rope tied into a loop, slip knot, or noose that can be thrown around a target to restraint it. It takes two hands to properly control a lasso. It doesn't cause any damage directly but can be used to grapple, restrain, and possibly strangle a target.

**Light Flail.** Two short sections of wood or metal connected by a small chain or hinge. Originally intended as a tool for threshing grain it can be used as a flexible bludgeoning weapon as well.

**Light Hammer.** A one-handed hammer useful as a hand tool, a bludgeon, or a throwing weapon. A favorite skirmishing weapon among dwarves, gnomes, and other mining races.

**Light Pick.** A small one-handed pick usually used for breaking up dirt or rocks but also useful for piercing flesh.

**Long Spear.** Longer than a normal spear, reaching lengths of up to 8', and requiring two hands to wield effectively.

**Mace.** A one-handed bludgeon specifically crafted as a weapon often having a heavy rounded or flanged head to increase the impact. Simple maces are issued to civil peace-keeping forces for protection and as a symbol of authority.

**Quarter Staff.** A rod of wood, or rarely metal, between four and six feet long, usually as tall as the wielder, that can be wielded as a weapon in one or two hands. A very common weapon among peasants, pilgrims, and monks for its versatility and simple craftsmanship.

**Shovel.** A digging tool with a flat metal blade on a long wooden handle.

**Sickle.** A small inwardly curved blade mounted on a short handle, basically a one-handed scythe and used in the collection of herbs and clearing of weeds. Similar to a machete, which has a single edged blade and used to chop away brush and debris. 

**Spear.** Spears are basically a longer and sturdier version of a javelin which can also be wielded in onr or two hands and also thrown. Spears are the most common weapon used throughout humanoid history and still in frequent use. A pitchfork can be used as a spear if necessary.

**Unarmed Strike.** All humanoids can perform an unarmed strike as an Attack action. It can represent a punch, kick, knee, headbutt, tail slam, shoulder throw, or any other brawling move.

Simple range weapons are typically used for hunting but can be used in battle when needed. Commoners often own a sling or a short bow while militia and town guards are frequently equipped with light crossbows.


**Dart.** A dart is a small javelin specialized for throwing with fletching, a shorter shaft, and a wieghted head. It can also be used as ammunititon for the **dart thrower** which extends the range and power of the dart.

**Dart Thrower.** A specialized tool for hurling **darts** further and harder than possible if thrown. Typically a length of wood roughly the length of the thrower's forearm with a notch at one end that hooks into the back of a dart. These are used by tribal humanoids that may not have access to bows or lack the strength to use other thrown weapons.

**Light Crossbow.** A small mechanical bow mounted horizontally onto a wooden stock which fires bolts when a trigger is depressed. The bow must be reset and bolts must be loaded individually between shots. A wall manned with guards equipped with light crossbows is an effective deterent.
