### Customizing Items

When creating your own weapons and armor or customizing existing here are a few guidelines that will help to keep things balanced:

* Simple weapons tend to do less damage and have fewer beneficial keywords than Martial weapons. 
* Common tools and farming implements also can be used as Simple weapons.
* Light weapons tend to do low damage since they can be used in the off-hand for a bonus attack.
* Finesse weapons tend to do low damage as well since they can be used in conjunction with Sneak Attack.
* Light and Finesse weapons should not also be Heavy.
* Reach and Two-handed weapons tend to be Heavy.
* Thrown weapons have a maximum range which is 3x its short range.
* Ammunition weapons have a maximum range which is 4x its short range.
* Heavy armor tends to be both restrictive and cumbersome.
* Avoid the temptation to add inherent attack, damage, or AC bonuses.
