#### Feats

Below are updates and changes to Feats due to the new properties, armor, shields, weapons, and optional rules presented in the material.

**Charger.** If you use the **Charging Attack** optional rule then this feat grants you a free attack at the end of your Dash and does not require a Bonus Action.

**Crossbow Expert.** It takes a Bonus Action rather than an Action to reload a **repeating** crossbow.

**Heavily Armored.** Gain proficiency with large shields and full helms.

**Lightly Armored.** Gain proficiency with small shields and caps.

**Moderately Armored.** Gain proficiency with medium shields and half helms.

**Polearm Master.** Add long hammer, long pick, long spear, pike, and spear to the list of weapons that work with this feat.

**Shield Master.** You no longer suffer any drawbacks from the **oversized** property and can ignore it.
