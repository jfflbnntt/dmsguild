### High Quality Items

In some cases it's okay to break the game balance guidelines above, especially when you want to create a unique and memorable item. High quality weapons and armor are rare, valuable, and highly sought after so their cost should reflect this. These items are expertly crafted and can be considered masterwork items, others are made of rare and wonderful materials that grant them special properties. High quality items can have one or more of the following benefits above and beyond the stats of its base stats:

#### Weapons

* Add the **brutal**, **crushing**, or **high crit** property.
* Add the **finesse** or **light** property, or remove the **heavy** property.
* Add the **powerdraw** property to a shortbow or longbow or add the **repeating** property to a crossbow
* Remove the **slow** or **weak** property.

#### Armor, Shield, or Helm

* Add the **covering**, **hardened** or **spiked** property.
* Remove the **hampering**, **occluding**, or **oversized** property.
* Reduce the weight of the item and reduce the STR requirement for the **encumbering** property, or remove it entirely.
