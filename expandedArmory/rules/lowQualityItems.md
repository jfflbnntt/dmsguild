### Low-quality Items

On the other hand you might wish to run a low-tech campaign or equip your NPCs with primative gear. Low-quality items might be old and worn out, damaged in some way, poorly crafted, or made from primative or sub-standard materials. In any case, low-quality items have one or more of the following drawbacks:

#### Weapon

* Add the **heavy**, **slow**, **weak**, **two-handed**, **oversized**, or **loading** property.
* Remove the **brutal**, **crushing**, **finesse**, **grappling**, **flexible**, **sneaky**, **high-crit**, **reach**, **lunging**, **versatile**, **light**, **powerdraw** or **reapeating** property
* Reduce the damage by one or more step, i.e. 1d10 becomes 1d8, 1d8 becomes 1d6, etc.
* Increase the weight of the item

#### Armor, Shield, Helm

* Remove the **covering**, **hardened**, or **spiked** property.
* Add the **hampering**, **occluding**, or **oversized** property.
* Reduce the AC bonus or formula by 1 or more.
* Increase the weight of the item and add or increase the STR requirement for the **encumbering** property.
