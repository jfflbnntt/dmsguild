### Low Quality Items

On the other hand you might wish to run a low-tech campaign or equip your monsters with primative gear. Low quality items might be old and worn out, damaged in some way, poorly crafted, or made from primative or sub-standard materials such as bronze, bone, stone, or wood. In any case, low quality items have one or more of the following drawbacks:

#### Weapon
* Add the **feeble** property or remove either the **high crit** or **brutal** property
* Add the **heavy** property or remove either the **light** or **finesse** property
* Add the **slow** property or remove the **balanced** property
* Add the **oversized** property if the weapon is **versatile**
* Increase the **brutal** STR requirement for **brutal** or **oversized** weapons

#### Armor or Shield
* Remove the **durable**, **tough**, or **spiked** property
* Add the **restrictive**, **cumbersome**, or **unwieldy** property
* Increase the STR requirement for the **cumbersome** property
* Increase the weight of the armor or shield
