### Low Quality Items

On the other hand you might wish to run a low-tech campaign or equip your NPCs with primative gear. Low quality items might be old and worn out, damaged in some way, poorly crafted, or made from primative or sub-standard materials. In any case, low quality items have one or more of the following drawbacks:

#### Weapon

* Add the **heavy**, **slow**, **weak**, **two-handed**, or **loading** property.
* Remove the **brutal**, **crushing**, **finesse**, **grappling**, **flexible**, **sneaky**, **high crit**, **reach**, **lunging**, **versatile**, **light**, **powerdraw** or **reapeating** property
* Increase the weight of the item

#### Armor, Shield, Helm

* Remove the **covering**, **hardened**, or **spiked** property.
* Add the **hampering**, **occluding**, or **oversized** property.
* Increase the weight of the item and add or increase the STR requirement for the **encumbering** property.
