#### Optional Variant Rules

Here are a few optional variant rules you can pick and choose from to add challenge or tactical options to spice up your combat and other aspects of your games.

**Flanking.** A coordinated attack from flanking positions is tactially advantageous. Although the Help Action is always an option in combat if you are Flanking with an ally you may perform the Help Action as a Reaction instead and can be triggered by the allies Attack. Flanking is defined by the rules described in the DMG, page 251, but does not grant Advantage automatically. This is a good option to add if your table misses tactical maneuvering on the battle field, but feel like the option presented in the DMG is too powerful. 

**Lingering Wounds.** Each time a character is brought to 0 HP, assuming they are not killed outright, they gain a level of Exhaustion. This represents receiving a grievous wound that lingers even if they are brought back to 1 or more HP. Exhaustion levels accumulate as usual and it is possible to die from Exhaustion by being dropped to 0 HP too many times. Use this option if you feel like falling in combat doesn't have realistic consequences.

**Charging Attack.** When taking the Dash Action you can use a Bonus Action to make a single melee weapon attack or shove a creature at the end of your movement. If you use this variant rule then the **Charger** feat no longer requires a bonus action to make an attack. Use this rule if you want combat to feel more dynamic and fast paced.

**Untrained Help.** If you attempt the Help Action with a skill in which you are not Proficient you must first succeed on a DC 10 check. If you are Proficient in the skill or performing the Help Action in combat with a weapon in in which you are Proficient you succeed on this check automatically. Use this rule if you want to characters to emphasize their trained skills.

**Charge Surge.** If a magic item which charges has a chance to be destroyed when the last charge is used then it also has a chance to surge. When the last charge is used roll a d20 as normal. If the result is a 20 then the item immediately regains charges as if it had regained charges on the following dawn. This rule rewards the characters for taking a chance on that last charge when the stakes are high.
