### New Armor and Shields

**Banded.** Heavy armor made from overlapping horizontal plates of metal attached to a padded leather undertunic. Also known as **banded plate**, **banded mail**, or **laminar armor**.

**Brigandine.** An armored coat with small rigid plates sewn between layers of cloth. Grants more protection than other light armors, but is heavier and a bit more restrictive as a trade-off. Also known as a **coat of plates** or **jack of plates**

**Breastplate, Half Plate, Field Plate, and Full Plate.** These armors consists of interlocking plates covering various parts of the body and chainmail protecting the joints. Breastplates just cover the vital areas of the torso. Half plate adds pauldrons and vambraces while field plate includes greaves, gorget and half-helm. Full plate finally adds sabatons, guantlets, and a great helm along with other pieces sheathing the entire body. It is possible to start with a breastplate and then slowly add the other pieces until you make it a full suit of plate armor.

**Heavy Shield.** A very large and heavy shield, sometimes as tall as 5', most often made of metal with a groove in the middle to help it stand upright when placed on the ground. A heavy shield can be set on the ground as an action and used as cover until picked up again with another action. Most often used on battlefields as a mobile piece of cover for soldiers and especially archers. Anyone with the heavy armor proficiency can also use heavy shields. Also known as a **pavise**, **mantlet**, **body**, or **tower** shield.

**Light Shield.** A small round shield usually made of wood or leather and possibly with metal rivets for reinforcement. Anyone with the light armor proficiency can use a light shield. Sometimes known as a **targe**, **target**, **round shield**, or **buckler**.

**Medium Shield.** A standard shield usually made of metal, or wood with metal reinforcement. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use medium shields. Examples include **scutum**, **heater**, and **kite** shields.

**Splint.** Heavy armor made from vertical metal ribs, or splints, attached to a backing of leather with chainmail covering the joints. Also known as **splint mail** or **splinted plate**.
