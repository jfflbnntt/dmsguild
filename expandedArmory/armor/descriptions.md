### Armor

Armor, shields, and helms come in three categories related to the proficiency needed to use them effectively: Light, Medium, and Heavy. 

Light armors are made of lightweight and flexible materials that cover the torso and arms. Medium and heavy armors tend to be made of more sturdy and heavier materials. Medium armor focuses on covering the torso and arms while heavy armor protects the entire body. Commoners rarely have any type of armor available, town guards and militia may be issued a suit of ring mail or a chain shirt, while professional soldiers typically wear chain mail.

**Padded.** Armor consisting of many thick layers of cloth and batting quilted together covering the chest and armes. It offers some protection while being cheap and easy to craft, however it's bulk somewhat hampers movement. Padded armor is more common than leather armor and just as protective. Common levies are often outfitted with this type of armor.

**Leather.** This armor is made of boiled or otherwise stiffened leather shaped and stitched together to cover the torso and shoulders and may include a skirt, or kilt to protect the thighs. It can be dyed various colors and ornamented in a variety of ways. It offers the same protection as padded armor while being slightly less bulky. Other materials like weaved and lacquered wicker can be made into armor just as effective as leather.

**Ring mail.** Ring mail is leather armor with a matrix of large metal rings attached to it. It offers better protect than regular leather armor, but is heavier and costs more. The rings can be made of a variety of metals or even be replaced with bone, stone, or other similar materials. Ring mail is more common in areas where full metal armors are harder to come by.

**Hide.** Hide armor typically consists of thick layers furs and hides, commonly worn by barbarian tribes, giants, and savage humanoids in areas where better materials are hard to come by. This armor can also represent piecemeal or patchwork armor of other types including the  sparse armor of gladiators which usually only includes a single spaulder and a wide leather belt.

**Chain shirt.** Chain mail is made of flexible mesh of small metal rings that protects only the torso and arms and might extend to the thighs. This is an incomplete suit of chain mail and is lighter and can be consealed beneath a tunic. Militia and town guards are often equipped with a simple chain hauberk.

**Scale mail.** Scale mail is armor that is made of overlapping metal scales, like those of a fish, attached to a leather backing that covers the torso and arms. Variants of scale armor are made entirely of small interlocking coins or discs, similar to ring mail. Scale armor is uniformly noisy.

**Breastplate.** Breastplates come in a variety of styles and ornamentation. They all consist of one or more large solid metal plates or discs covering the vital parts of the chest while leaving the arms and legs unprotected, sacrificing additonal protection while remaining relatively unencumbered. Breastplates form the basis of all other **hardened** plate armors that protect against **brutal** and **high crit** weapons. Breastplates are expensive and generally only worn by honor guards, knights, and other nobles.

**Half plate.** Half plate includes a breastplate, pauldrons, and vambraces to protect the arms all worn over a chain shirt to protect the joints. The increased protection comes with more encumbrance and less flexibility. Like breastplates only the wealthy and priviledged tend to be able to afford to wear half plate.

**Brigandine.** Brigandine consists of a long knee-lengthed armored coat with small rigid plates stitched or riveted between layers of cloth, cinched at the waist by a sturdy leather belt. It is often mistaken for "studded" armor due to the metal rivets or "studs" that sometimes show through the cloth layer. It is the cheapest and lightest of the heavy armors and is also known as a coat of plates. It is a favored type of armor amongst mercenaries for its balance of protection and cost.

**Chain mail.** A full suit of small interlocking metal rings over a layer of padded armor to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. It includes chain gauntlets and leg coverings. Full plate armor made of softer metals is equivalent to chain mail in protection. Chain mail is the most common type of heavy armor and frequently used by professional soldiers.

**Plate mail.** Plate mail is comprised of interlocking metal plates with chain mail covering the joints all over a cushioning layer of fabric padding or leather. Banded mail is made with horizontal layers of plate mail while splinted mail is arranged vertically.

**Full plate.** Full plate covers the entire body with interlocking shaped metal plates. It includes everything in a suit of half plate but adds thigh, knee guards, greaves, and sabatons to protect the legs. Due to the cost only the most wealthy knights and nobles can afford to wear this type of armor.

**Heavy plate.** Heavy plate is a suit of full plate made of reinforced heavy metal plates that only the strongest of warriors can effectively fight in. This armor is extremely rare and valuable.


### Shields

Shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can be made of leather, wood, metal, or a combination. Medium shields are the most commonly used, offering decent protection without the drawbacks of larger shields. 

**Small Shield.** A small lightweight round shield usually made of wood or leather and possibly with metal rim or boss for reinforcement. Anyone with the light armor proficiency can use a light shield. Sometimes known as a targe, target, leaf shield, or buckler.

**Medium Shield.** A standard shield usually made of metal, or wood with metal reinforcement. They often bear the heraldric arms of the wielder or the local lord. It is also the largest shield that can be effectively used while mounted. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use medium shields. Examples include heater, kite, parma, round, and teardrop shields.

**Large Shield.** A very large and heavy shield, sometimes as tall as the wielder, and most frequently made of metal. Most often used on battlefields as a mobile piece of cover for archers or soldiers in a shield wall. Anyone with the heavy armor proficiency can also use heavy shields however small creatures must use two hands when using it. Comes in many varieties including aspis, pavise, body, or tower shields.


### Helms

Helms offer protection only when combined with an appropriate set of armor. Helms cover progressively more of the head the heavier they are. A helm can be donned or removed with an Action.

**Cap.** Caps are lightweight helms that protect the crown of the head. They can be used by anyone with the light armor proficiency and can be added to any suit of light armor. Types of caps including stiff leather hoods, a thick padded cloth cap, a steel skullcap, or a kettle or pot helm.

**Half helm.** Half helms balance protection and visibility. They cover more of the head, neck, ears, and face, often including eye and nose guards or chain mail fringe, while leaving the lower portion of the face exposed. Peripheral vision and hearing is noticeably muffled while wearing these types of helms. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use a half helm when combined with a suit of medium or light armor. Examples include chain coifs, barbutes, conical helms, sallets, or even an oversized skull worn as a helmet.

**Full helm.** A full helm covers the entire head and often interlocks with a gorget for neck protection. These helms are pierced with small eye slots and breathing holes and sometimes include a visor that can be lifted. Full helms can be used effectively by anyone with the heavy armor proficiency when combined with a suit of heavy, medium, or light armor. Full helms come in a variety of styles and are often augmented with horsehair mohawks, wings, antlers, and other decorations. Examples include bascinets, bucket helms, or great helms.
