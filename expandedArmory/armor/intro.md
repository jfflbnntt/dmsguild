## Armor

Armor, shields, and helms come in three categories related to the proficiency needed to use them effectively: Light, Medium, and Heavy. 

Light armors are made of layers of cloth and leather while medium and heavy armors tend to use metal rings and plates. Light and medium armors focus on protecting only the vital areas while heavy armor protects the entire body. Heavy armor also tends to be both restrictive and cumbersome. Commoners rarely have anything more than a gambeson, town guards and militia may be issued a suit of ring mail or a chain shirt, while professional soldiers typically wear brigandine or a full suit of chain mail.

Just as some weapons pose unique threats, the right kind of armor can neutralize those threats at the cost of increased encumbrance and reduced mobility. A helm paired with an appropriate suit of armor offers superior protection while limiting perception. A shield is not only useful in deflecting blows in close combat, but can be particularly effective against missiles attacks.

The following are a few new properties along with new options for armor and shields with their own benefits and drawbacks. These are new properties for armor, shields, and helms. In some cases they replace existing table elements defined in the PHB.
