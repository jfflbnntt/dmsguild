## Armor

Armor, shields, and helms come in three categories related to the proficiency needed to use them effectively: Light, Medium, and Heavy. 

Light armors are made of layers of cloth and leather while medium and heavy armors tend to use metal rings and plates. Light and medium armors focus on protecting only the vital areas while heavy armor protects the entire body. Heavy armor also tends to be both restrictive and cumbersome. Commoners rarely have any type of armor available, town guards and militia may be issued a suit of ring mail or a chain shirt, while professional soldiers typically wear chain mail.
