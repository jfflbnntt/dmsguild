### Shields

Shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can be made of leather, wood, metal, or other improvised materials. They can sometimes include a reinforced rim and metal boss for added durability. Medium shields are the most commonly used, offering decent protection without the drawbacks of larger shields. Intelligent creatures generally use shields on their own or in combination with armor.

* **Small Shield.** A small lightweight shield usually round and held extended from the body by one hand. An improvised shield is usually only effective as a small shield. Anyone with the light armor proficiency can use small shields.

* **Medium Shield.** A standard sized shield that is typically held close to the body with the off-hand and further supported by straps on the upper arm or shoulders. They often bear the heraldric arms of the wielder or a local lord. It is also the largest shield that can be effectively used while mounted. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use medium shields.

* **Large Shield.** A tall shield that is strapped to the forearm and supported by resting the bottom on the ground when not moving. It is frequently used on battlefields as a mobile piece of cover for archers or soldiers in a shield wall. Anyone with the heavy armor proficiency can also use large shields, however due to the **oversized** property it cannot be used while mounted and small creatures must use two hands when wielding it.
