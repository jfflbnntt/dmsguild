### Shields

Shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can be made of leather, wood, metal, or other improvised materials. Medium shields are the most commonly used, offering decent protection without the drawbacks of larger shields. Intelligent creatures generally use shields on their own or in combination with armor.

**Small Shield.** A small lightweight shield usually round and made of wood or leather and possibly with metal rim or boss for reinforcement. It covers up to one-quarter of the wielder. An improvised shield is usually only effective as a small shield. Anyone with the light armor proficiency can use a light shield.

**Medium Shield.** A standard shield usually made of metal, or wood with metal reinforcement that covers up to one-half of the wielder. They often bear the heraldric arms of the wielder or the local lord. It is also the largest shield that can be effectively used while mounted. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use medium shields.

**Large Shield.** A very large and heavy shield covers up to three-quarters of the wielder and most often made of metal. It is frequently used on battlefields as a mobile piece of cover for archers or soldiers in a shield wall. Anyone with the heavy armor proficiency can also use heavy shields, however due to the **oversized** property it cannot be used while mounted and small creatures must use two hands when wielding it.
