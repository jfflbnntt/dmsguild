### Light Armor

**Gambeson.** Armor consisting of many thick layers of cloth and batting quilted together covering the chest and armes. It offers some protection while being cheap and easy to craft. Gambeson armor is more common than leather armor and is often worn under heavier armors for comfort and added protection. Common levies are typically outfitted with this type of armor.

**Leather.** This armor is made of pieces of thick but pliable leather shaped and stitched together to cover the torso and shoulders and may include a skirt, or kilt to protect the thighs. It can be dyed various colors and ornamented in a variety of ways. It offers the same protection as a gambeson while being slightly less bulky and more expensive. Other materials like weaved and lacquered wicker can be made into armor just as effective as leather.

**Ring Mail.** Ring mail is leather armor with a matrix of large metal rings attached to it. It offers better protect than regular leather armor, but is heavier and costs more. The rings can be made of a variety of metals or even be replaced with bone, stone, or other similar materials. Ring mail is more common in areas where full metal armors are harder to come by and it is favored by pirates over heavier armors.

### Medium Armor

**Breastplate.** Breastplates come in a variety of styles and ornamentation. They all consist of one or more large solid metal plates or discs covering the vital parts of the chest while leaving the arms and legs unprotected, sacrificing additonal protection while remaining relatively unencumbered. Breastplates form the basis of all other **hardened** plate armors. Breastplates are expensive and generally only worn by honor guards, knights, and other nobles.

**Chain Shirt.** Chain mail is made of flexible mesh of small metal rings. A chain shirt protects only the torso and upper arms and might extend to the thighs, but is lighter than a full suit of chain mail and is can be concealed beneath a tunic. Militia and town guards are often equipped with a simple chain byrnie.

**Half Plate.** Half plate includes a metal breastplate, sometimes paired with pauldrons, worn over a chain shirt to protect the joints. Only the wealthy and priviledged can afford to wear half plate. Like breastplates is has the **hardened** property. The increased protection comes with more encumbrance and less flexibility, hence the **hampering** property.

**Hide.** Hide armor typically consists of thick layers furs and hides, hard chitin, or boiled and stiffened leathers, commonly worn by barbarian tribes, giants, and savage humanoids in areas where better materials are hard to come by. This armor can also represent piecemeal or patchwork armor of other types including the sparse armor of gladiators which usually only includes a single spaulder and a wide leather belt.

**Scale Mail.** Scale mail is armor that is made of overlapping metal scales, like those of a fish, attached to a leather backing that covers the torso and arms. Variants of scale armor are made entirely of small interlocking coins or discs, similar to ring mail. Scale armor is uniformly bulky and noisy.

### Heavy Armor

**Brigandine.** Brigandine consists of a long knee-lengthed armored coat with small rigid plates stitched or riveted between layers of cloth, cinched at the waist by a sturdy leather belt. It is often mistaken for "studded" armor due to the metal rivets or "studs" that sometimes show through the cloth layer. It is the cheapest and lightest of the heavy armors. It is a favored type of armor amongst mercenaries and amateur adventurers for its balance of protection and cost.

**Full Chain.** A full suit of small interlocking metal rings worn over a gambeson to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. It includes chain gauntlets and leg coverings. Chain mail is the most common type of heavy armor and frequently used by professional soldiers.

**Full Plate.** Full plate covers the entire body with interlocking shaped metal plates. It includes everything in a suit of half plate and adds guantlets, thigh guards, knee guards, greaves, and sabatons. Due to the cost only the most wealthy knights and nobles can afford to wear this type of armor.

**Heavy Plate.** Heavy plate is a suit of full plate made of reinforced heavy metal plates that only the strongest of warriors can effectively fight in. This armor is extremely rare and valuable.

**Plate Mail.** Plate mail is comprised of interlocking metal plates with chain mail covering the joints all over a gambeson. It includes gauntlets, spaulders, heavy boots, and leg coverings.
