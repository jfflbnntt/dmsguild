### Helms

Helms offer protection only when combined with an appropriate set of armor. Helms cover progressively more of the head the heavier they while gradually reducing more visibility and muffling sounds. A helm can be donned or removed with an Action.

**Cap.** Caps are lightweight helms that protect the crown and top of the head. They can be used by anyone with the light armor proficiency and can be added to any suit of light armor. Caps commonly issued to archers and low ranking foot soldiers.

**Half Helm.** Half helms balance protection and visibility. They cover more of the head, neck, ears, and face, often including eye and nose guards or chain mail fringe, while leaving the lower portion of the face exposed. Peripheral vision and hearing is noticeably obstructed while wearing these types of helms. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use a half helm when combined with a suit of medium armor. They are typically worn by warriors of significant rank.

**Full Helm.** A full helm covers the entire head and often interlocks with a gorget for neck protection. These helms are pierced with small eye slots and breathing holes and sometimes include a visor that can be lifted for better visibility as an action. Full helms can be used effectively by anyone with the heavy armor proficiency when combined with a suit of heavy armor. Full helms come in a variety of styles and are often augmented with horsehair mohawks, wings, antlers, and other heraldic decorations. They are typically only worn by warlords and battle commanders.
