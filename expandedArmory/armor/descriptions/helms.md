### Helms

Helms offer protection only when combined with an appropriate set of armor. Helms cover progressively more of the head the heavier they while gradually reducing more visibility and muffling sounds. A helm can be donned or removed with an Action.

**Cap.** Caps are lightweight helms that protect the crown and top of the head. They can be used by anyone with the light armor proficiency and can be added to any suit of light armor. Types of caps including stiff leather hoods, a thick padded cloth cap, a steel skullcap, or a kettle or pot helm issued to archers and town guards.

**Half Helm.** Half helms balance protection and visibility. They cover more of the head, neck, ears, and face, often including eye and nose guards or chain mail fringe, while leaving the lower portion of the face exposed. Peripheral vision and hearing is noticeably obstructed while wearing these types of helms. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use a half helm when combined with a suit of medium or light armor. Examples include chain coifs, barbutes, conical helms, sallets, or even an oversized skull worn as a helmet. They are typically worn by officers of rank.

**Full Helm.** A full helm covers the entire head and often interlocks with a gorget for neck protection. These helms are pierced with small eye slots and breathing holes and sometimes include a visor that can be lifted. Full helms can be used effectively by anyone with the heavy armor proficiency when combined with a suit of heavy, medium, or light armor. Full helms come in a variety of styles and are often augmented with horsehair mohawks, wings, antlers, and other heraldic decorations. Examples include bascinets, bucket helms, or great helms. They are typically only worn by nobles when riding into battle.
