### Helms

Helms offer protection only when worn with an appropriate set of armor. Helms cover progressively more of the head and face the heavier they are while gradually reducing visibility and muffling sounds.

* **Cap.** Caps are lightweight helms that protect the crown and top of the head. They can be used by anyone with the light armor proficiency and can be added to any suit of light armor. Donning or removing a cap counts as interacting with an object and can be performed as part of movement. Caps are commonly issued to archers and low ranking foot soldiers.

* **Half Helm.** Half helms balance protection and visibility. They cover more of the head, neck, ears, and face, often including eye and nose guards or chain mail fringe, while leaving the lower portion of the face exposed. Peripheral vision and hearing is noticeably obstructed while wearing these types of helms. Anyone with the medium armor proficiency can use a half helm when combined with a suit of medium armor. It takes an Action to don or remove a half helm since they are secured in place by a chin strap. They are typically worn by warriors of significant rank.

* **Full Helm.** A full helm covers the entire head and often interlocks with a gorget for neck protection. These helms are pierced with small eye slots and breathing holes and sometimes include a visor. Donning or removing a full helm requires an action, but a visor can be raised or lowered as part of movement. When the visor is raised the helm acts as a half helm for purposes of AC and **occluding**. Full helms can be used effectively by anyone with the heavy armor proficiency when combined with a suit of heavy armor. Full helms come in a variety of styles and are often augmented with horsehair mohawks, wings, antlers, and other heraldic decorations. They are typically only worn by warlords and battle commanders.
