### Armor Properties
___

* **Covering.** You can use your Reaction to double the shield's AC bonus against a single ranged weapon or spell attack. This property can be used in conjunction with the **Shield Master** feat.

* **Cumbersome.** Wearing armor without the required strength reduces your movement speed by 5 feet. This reduced speed is in addition to any due to endurance. This property replaces the STR requirement listed in the PHB armor table.

* **Hardened.** Armor made of rigid plates is reinforced and better covers vital areas providing improved protection against grevious wounds. The wearer effectively ignores the effects of weapon properties **brutal**, **high-crit**, and **staggering**.

* **Occluding.** Protective headgear can reduce periferal vision and dampens sounds. The wearer of helms with this property suffers a penalty on passive perception checks equal to the number in parentheses.

* **Oversized.** Oversized shields cannot be used while mounted and cannot be wielded by small creatures without two hands.

* **Restricting.** Armor with the this property is bulky and restricts the full range of motion. It cannot be easily disguised and makes it difficult to move quickly and quietly. The wearer has Disadvantage with Dexterity (Stealth) checks and Strength (Athletics) checks relating to swimming, climbing, and jumping while wearing this armor. This property replaces the Stealth Disadvantage column of the PHB armor table.

* **Spiked.** Armor and shields with this property have been embellished with intimidating metal spikes or something equally dangerous. A shield with spikes does 1d4 piercing damage instead of bludgeoning when used as a weapon or as part of a shove attack. A creature who grapples or is grappled by another creature in spiked armor takes 1d4 piercing damage from the spikes. Armor with spikes also gains the **hampering** property if it doesn't already.
