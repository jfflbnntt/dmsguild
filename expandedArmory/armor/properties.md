### Armor, Shield, and Helm Properties

The following are a few new properties along with new options for armor and shields with their own benefits and drawbacks. These are new properties for armor, shields, and helms. In some cases they replace existing table elements defined in the PHB.

**Covering.** You can use your Reaction to double the shield's AC bonus against a single ranged weapon or spell attack.

**Encumbering.** Wearing armor or weilding a shield without the required strength increases your Encumbrance rating by 1 level. This property replaces the STR requirement listed in the PHB armor table.

**Hampering.** Armor and shields with the this property is either bulky, restricts the full range of motion, cannot be disguised, or makes it difficult to move quickly and quietly. The wearer has Disadvantage with Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wearing this armor. This property replaces the Stealth Disadvantage column of the PHB armor table.

**Hardened.** Armor made of rigid plates is reinforced and better covers vital areas providing improved protection against grevious wounds. The wearer effectively ignores the effects of weapon properties **brutal** and **high crit**.

**Occluding.** Protective headgear can reduce periferal vision and dampens sounds. The wearer of helms with this property suffers a penalty on passive perception checks equal to the number in parentheses.

**Oversized.** Oversized shields cannot be used while mounted and cannot be wielded by small creatures without two hands.

**Spiked.** Armor and shields with this property have been embellished with intimidating metal spikes or something equally dangerous. A shield with spikes does 1d4 piercing damage instead of bludgeoning when used as a weapon or as part of a shove attack. A creature who grapples or is grappled by another creature in spiked armor takes 1d4 piercing damage from the spikes. Armor with spikes also gains the **hampering** property if it doesn't already.
