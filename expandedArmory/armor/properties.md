### New Armor and Shield Properties

**Covering.** Shields with the **covering** property can be treated as cover while crouching behind it. When prone medium shields provide half-cover and heavy shields provide three-quarter cover to the creature using it, assuming the shield is apropriately sized for the creature in question. Light shields do not provide any cover. Take only the AC bonus from the shield or cover condition depending on how it's being used, but not both.

**Cumbersome.** Armor with this property weighs the wearer down and can slow movement. The wearer must meet the minimum STR requirement in the parenthese or have their base movement speed be reduced by 10' while wearing this armor.

**Durable.** This armor provides additional protection and cushioning against heavy hitting impacts from **brutal** weapons, effectively allowing the wearer to ignore that property. All damage from **brutal** weapons is rolled normally.

**Obscuring.** This armor includes a helmet that partially obscures your vision and hearing. All Wisdom (Perception) checks are made at Disadvantage while wearing this armor.

**Restrictive.** Armor with this property restricts the full range of motion, making it difficult to move quickly and quietly. The wearer has Disadvantage with Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wearing this armor.

**Spiked.** Armor and shields with this property have been embellished with intimidating metal spikes or something equally dangerous. A shield with spikes does 1d4 piercing damage instead of bludgeoning when used as a weapon or as part of a shove attack. A creature who grapples or is grappled by another creature in spiked armor takes 1d4 piercing damage from the spikes. Armor with spikes also gains the **restrictive** property if it doesn't already.

**Tough.** This armor is reinforced and covers the vital areas better making it harder to land deadly blows and allowing the wearer to ignore the **high crit** property of any weapons. Roll damage normally for a critical hit from any **high crit** weapons.

**Unwieldy.** Heavy shields are bulky and cumbersome and make it difficult to fight while carrying. All attack rolls are made at Disadvantage while carrying a large shield.
