### Armor, Shield, and Helm Properties

**Covering.** When targeted by an effect that allows a Dexterity Saving Throw the weilder of this shield may use their Reaction to add the shield's AC bonus to their saving throw roll. If the weilder already has cover from another source they only benefit from one source of their choice.

**Encumbering.** Wearing armor or weilding a shield without the required strength increases your Encumbrance rating by 1 level.

**Hampering.** Armor and shields with the this property is either bulky, restricts the full range of motion, cannot be disguised, or makes it difficult to move quickly and quietly. The wearer has Disadvantage with Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wearing this armor.

**Hardened.** Armor made of rigid plates is reinforced and better covers vital areas providing improved protection against grevious wounds. The wearer effectively ignores the effects of weapon properties **brutal** and **high crit**.

**Occluding.** Protective headgear can reduce periferal vision and dampens sounds. The wearer of helms with this property suffers a penalty on passive perception checks equal to the number in parentheses.

**Oversized.** Heavy shields cannot be used while mounted and cannot be wielded by small creatures without two hands.

**Spiked.** Armor and shields with this property have been embellished with intimidating metal spikes or something equally dangerous. A shield with spikes does 1d4 piercing damage instead of bludgeoning when used as a weapon or as part of a shove attack. A creature who grapples or is grappled by another creature in spiked armor takes 1d4 piercing damage from the spikes. Armor with spikes also gains the **hampering** property if it doesn't already.
